Renowned photographer Silpi Nalini Kanta Baruah graced the event as the chief guest. The India Inter-Nation Photography Council awarded Baruah in 1955 and in 1981 he was awarded at the International Color Slide Exhibition in Italy. Renowned astrophotographer of Assam, Dipankar Bhagawati aka Stephen Styris was invited as the resource person of the workshop, where around 50 students/ faculty and staff members of Tezpur University participated. On the occasion, the department displayed over 100 photographs in an exhibition organized at the department premises. These photographs were submitted by photography enthusiasts from across the country for a photography competition organized by the department. The theme for the competition was open while there were two categories: Student and non-student. Prof Abhijit Bora of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism delivered the welcome address while the inaugural speech was delivered by the Head of the Department, Prof Joya Chakraborty. The Registrar of Tezpur University, Dr. Biren Das and Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof Dhruba Kumar Bhattacharyya also graced the occasion with their presence. The Department felicitated Silpi Nalini Kanta Baruah for his significant contributions of over 70 years towards the art of photography. The 92-year-old photographer inaugurated the exhibition at the department and said, "The youngsters have done a great job. In our time, we didn\'t have digital cameras, for which photography was harder in comparison to the present times. But I still tried my best to click some good photographs. I am yet to capture the best photograph of my life and I won\'t die before that." "I am elated to receive this honour from the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism" Baruah added. In the workshop, Stephen Styris discussed about the science behind taking a photograph, the requisite skills for it and implementation of various learning in different genres of photography.

The human milk embankment, named as 'Amrit Kosh', has been situated at the Paropakar Maternity and Women's Hospital. The bank has the provision of gathering, pasteurizing, examining, and reserving safe donors for lactating women as the prerequisite for breastfeeding in times of need. The centre of the bank has been established in collaboration between the Nepal Government and UNICEF along with European Union. According to a press release issued by UNICEF Nepal, the milk bank has the potential to ensure newborn-friendly health systems and to proffer infants and other at-risk babies access to the extensive amount of breast milk benefits whenever it is requisite. Annually, over 15 million early mature infants are born across the globe and around 81,000 premature newborns have been estimated in Nepal. Earlier in February 2021, India's Kerala state inaugurated its first-stage human milk bank by the Health Minister of Kerela K K Shailaja at the Ernakulam General Hospital. The bank has the prerequisite for ensuring breast milk for infants who are not being able to be lactated by their own mothers. The milk, which will be accumulated from lactating women, can be reserved for six months at the bank store. The milk bank has been named 'Nectar of Life' and it is worth Rs. 35 lakh. It was established by Cochin Global's Rotary Club in collaboration with the Kerala Health Department. It includes deep freezers, a pasteurisation unit, refrigerators, breast pumps etc where trained nurses have been assigned to operate the bank.Also Read: Mumbai Police Receive Threat Message of Another '26/11 Style Attack'Also Watch : ",pubDate:"2022-08-20 08:24:27",image_url:"https://assets.sentinelassam.com/h-upload/2022/08/20/500x300_376701-milk-donation.jpg",source_id:"sentinel",country:["india"],category:["top"],language:"english"},{title:"Desmantelan en la India una banda que dirig\xeda una falsa estaci\xf3n policial cerca de la comisar\xeda real",link:"https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/439086-desmantelan-india-banda-dirigia-durante?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all",keywords:null,creator:["RT en Espa\xf1ol"],video_url:null,description:"Los delincuentes que operaban desde un hotel cobraban a las personas que acud\xedan a la falsa comisar\xeda para presentar denuncias.",content:null,pubDate:"2022-08-20 08:15:12",image_url:"https://cdni.russiatoday.com/actualidad/public_images/2022.08/thumbnail/63008eb0e9ff715c2f49e3c9.jpg",source_id:"rt_mx",country:["mexico"],category:["top"],language:"spanish"},{title:"India vs Zimbabwe Live Score 2nd ODI: Siraj gets breakthrough for IND - Hindustan Times",link:"https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vY3JpY2tldC9pbmRpYS12cy16aW1iYWJ3ZS1saXZlLXNjb3JlLTJuZC1vZGktMjAyMi1pbmQtdnMtemltLXRvZGF5LW1hdGNoLWxhdGVzdC1zY29yZS11cGRhdGVzLTEwMTY2MDk3MjczNTU2Mi5odG1s0gEA?oc=5",keywords:null,creator:null,video_url:null,description:"India vs Zimbabwe Live Score 2nd ODI: Siraj gets breakthrough for IND  Hindustan TimesMatch Preview - Zimbabwe vs India, India in Zimbabwe 2022, 2nd ODI  ESPNcricinfoIndia vs Zimbabwe Head To Head Records, 2nd ODI, India Tour Of Zimbabwe 2022  Cricket AddictorLIVE IND vs ZIM 2nd ODI Cricket Score: Kaia and Kaitano Open Innings For Zimbabwe, India Search For Early Wic  India.comIND vs ZIM 2nd ODI Live Score Updates: Zimbabwe three down, Shardul Thakur picks two quick wickets  The Indian ExpressView Full coverage on Google News",content:null,pubDate:"2022-08-20 08:14:45",image_url:null,source_id:"google",country:["india"],category:["sports"],language:"english"},{title:"World of cricket: Paddy Upton once again a member of Team India support staff",link:"https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/paddy-upton-team-india-karuna-jain-retires-from-the-world-of-cricket/article65790513.ece",keywords:null,creator:["\n        Abhishek Mukherjee  \n    "],video_url:null,description:"Paddy Upton has been appointed as India\u2019s mental conditioning coach till the T20 World Cup; Laxmi Ratan Shukla will be Bengal\u2019s new head coach",content:null,pubDate:"2022-08-20 08:12:06",image_url:null,source_id:"sportstar",country:["india"],category:["sports"],language:"english"},{title:"Zimbabwe vs India Live Score Ball by Ball, Zimbabwe vs India 2022 Live Cricket Score Of Today's Match on NDTV Sports",link:"https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/zimbabwe-vs-india-live-score-over-2nd-odi-odi-11-15-updates-3270683",keywords:null,creator:null,video_url:null,description:"Live Updates of Today Match between Zimbabwe vs India from Harare Sports Club, Harare.

The messages that were sent to the Mumbai traffic police's helpline number were sent from a Pakistani number. The sender warned that the attack would be executed soon in Mumbai city to revive the memories of the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008. Even though the Mumbai police have ruled out the potential threat of attack, they have now begun an investigation on the matter and are trying to trace the sender. According to police, the sender stated in the WhatsApp messages sent to the Mumbai traffic police that he is from Pakistan and an attack will be carried out in Mumbai. The person said that he is from Pakistan and that there are a few in India who are helping him to carry out the attack. He also shared some mobile numbers and warned that the attack could be carried out akin to the Sidhu Moosewala murder or the Udaipur tailor killing this year. \"We are probing the origin of the threat messages. We will soon trace the sender. We are also taking all necessary precautions in the city in view of the threat message,\" said a police officer. The messages come two days after a boat laden with AK-47 guns and ammunition was found off the Raigad coast of Maharashtra. One of India's most horrific terrorist attacks took place on November 26, 2008. Ten terrorists wreaked havoc across Mumbai killing over 150 people and injuring 300.

Third seed Carlos Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows last year, beat former US Open champion Marin Cilic 7-6 (4),6-1 to set up a meeting with British world number 11 Cameron Norrie, who downed American Ben Shelton 6-0, 6-2. Medvedev suffered a jarring early exit from the Canadian Masters last week but overcame some initial problems in a tricky tie against Shapovalov to edge both sets and book a meeting with American Fritz. "In general, I managed to be pretty constant," said Medvedev. "I got a lot of break opportunities. Broke first in the first set. Served pretty well even in the game where I lost my serve. In general, happy with my level and looking forward to the next matches." Fritz had to fight back from a set down to beat Rublev 6-7 (4), 6-2, 7-5 on Center Court, finding his rhythm in the second set and pounding a dozen winners past the Russian to ensure he would continue his rise up the rankings. "Obviously, I want to go even further, semis, finals, win the title but to put another Masters quarter-final on the record for the year helps a lot," said the Indian Wells champion, who stands on the brink of entering the top 10 for the first time. Croatian Coric backed up his stunning victory over Rafa Nadal late on Wednesday by taking out another Spaniard in Roberto Bautista Agut. Former World No 12 Coric is still on the comeback trail after shoulder surgery but showed he should not be underestimated at the US Open with a clinical 6-2, 6-3 victory. A quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2020, Coric will next face Canadian seventh seed Auger-Aliassime, who saved two match points in the second set in a stunning 2-6, 7-6 (1) 6-1 comeback victory over Italian Jannick Sinner. Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas took down Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3 in a little over 90 minutes after the Argentine served up nine double faults and will next face American John Isner, a 7-6 (3), 1-6, 7-6(4) winner over compatriot Sebastian Korda.Swiatek, Raducanu, Kontaveit ousted World number one Iga Swiatek and reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu were both knocked out of the Cincinnati Open on Thursday, while second seed Anett Kontaveit also had her preparations for Flushing Meadows cut short in the round of 16. Raducanu had beaten former Grand Slam champions Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka in the previous two rounds but was brought down to earth with a bump in a 7-5, 6-4 loss to American seventh seed Jessica Pegula. Another American, Madison Keys, earlier accounted for Swiatek to take her place in the quarter-finals and register her first win over a reigning world number one. Swiatek saved four match points but was far from her best as she exited a second tournament in the North American swing at the last-16 stage after last week\'s Canadian Open. Keys had failed to take a set off the Pole in two previous meetings but was far more clinical with her powerful returns and groundstrokes, breaking the world number one five times in the 6-3, 6-4 victory. Keys will next face Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who beat Alison Riske-Amritraj 6-2, 6-4 to sail into the quarter-finals. Wimbledon finalist and fifth seed Ons Jabeur also made her exit, ushered out of the door by twice major winner Petra Kvitova 6-1, 4-6, 6-0. Kvitova next faces Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, who staged a stunning comeback to beat Russian Veronika Kudermetova 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3 and reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final. World number two Kontaveit looked to have taken charge of her tie against Zhang Shuai when she won the opening set at a canter but her Chinese opponent dug deep to claim a stunning 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 upset. Eighth seed Aryna Sabalenka later takes on Shelby Rogers for a place in the last eight.

(Picture: Getty) Rejoice! For rain has blessed us once again. After that gruelling heatwave (RIP to all grass everywhere), we finally have miserable British weather back again. While most of us never thought we\u2019d want rain to beckon, it has been nice to have some coolness and watch our gardens and green spaces get some much-needed moisture. And if you were out and about while it poured down, or indeed near a garden, you would\u2019ve smelled that fresh earthy fragrance. Chances are, you took a right big whiff of the stuff, and it was more fragrant than ever. The scent you\u2019re smelling (and likely enjoying) isn\u2019t just because you haven\u2019t seen the heavens open up in a while, it\u2019s actually a scientific response to rainfall after a drought and the like. Scientists at MIT have figured out that rain releases an aromatic aerosol which creates that familiar smell, particulalry after a long period without. And we love this fragrance (there\u2019s even perfumes and candles that try to imitate it) as humans are extremely sensitive to the geosmin that makes up this particular smell, and we can detect in very small quantities, as low as five parts per trillion. Give it a sniff (Picture: Getty Images/EyeEm) Using high-speed cameras, the researchers observed that when a raindrop hits a porous surface, it traps tiny air bubbles at the point of contact. As in a glass of champagne, the bubbles then shoot upward, ultimately bursting from the drop in a fizz of aerosols. The researchers suspect that in natural environments, aerosols may carry aromatic elements, along with bacteria and viruses stored in soil. These aerosols may be released during light or moderate rainfall, and then spread via gusts of wind. In heavy rainfall though, they may be less evident as they\u2019re washed away. \u2018Rain happens every day \u2014 it\u2019s raining now, somewhere in the world,\u2019 said Cullen R. Buie, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. \u2018It\u2019s a very common phenomenon, and it was intriguing to us that no one had observed this mechanism before.\u2019 The scientists can also use this evidence to look into soil-based disease.

Industry super fund vehicle IFM Investors also having significant funds in renewable assets through its infrastructure debt team.The report also calls on the government to consider ways that funds can participate in nation building projects, particularly through private equity and unlisted assets.It calls on the government to nominate \u201cstrategic industries of the future\u201d and create more efficient, sector-based incentives to encourage the flow of capital to them.The paper \u2013 which comes at a time when some critics have questioned whether the extensive unlisted assets held by industry super funds are accurately valued \u2013 argues that the sector\u2019s investments in those assets give its funds an investment return edge.\u201cIndustry super funds\u2019 $100bn in unlisted assets not only provides excellent investment returns to members, but they also create jobs, increase productivity and fuel economic growth,\u201d the report reads. \u201cIndustry funds have greater exposure to unlisted assets such as property, infrastructure and equities than retail funds.\u201dIt says the higher exposure to unlisted assets means that a 40 year old member would have been more than $11,000 better off over the past 10 years, giving them an extra $137,000 at their retirement. The report says industry super funds currently hold investments in projects which are helping to abate 3.6 million tonnes of carbon annually with developments in place which will take this to 14.2 million a year by 2030.$100 INVESTED 10 YEARS AGO IS NOW WORTH \u2026The report, which seeks to detail the broad range of investment by industry funds in areas from agriculture to manufacturing and start-ups to debt financing, is part of a campaign by the sector to show its support as a long term supplier of capital for local industry.But the sector is also pushing the government for more policy stability, including legislation protecting it from any new policies for early access to superannuation, such as the Morrison governments\u2019 early access scheme in 2020 and the proposal to make superannuation available for first home buyers put forward by the Morrison government before the election.\u201cProtecting, rather than trashing the fundamentals of the super system is the key to leveraging the power of our investment capacity to do good and strengthen our economy,\u201d Mr Dean said.",pubDate:"2022-08-22 07:00:00",image_url:null,source_id:"couriermail",country:["australia"],category:["business"],language:"english"},{title:"Radiostudio SRF zieht um: \xabEs ist ein Abschied mit Tr\xe4nen\xbb",link:"https://www.blick.ch/schweiz/zuerich/radiostudio-srf-zieht-um-es-ist-ein-abschied-mit-traenen-id17807641.html",keywords:null,creator:["Weiss Eliane (wel)"],video_url:null,description:"Thomas Mann, Josephine Baker und Ueli Beck: Das SRF-Radiostudio Z\xfcrich am Brunnenhof liess die Nation fast 90 Jahre lang aufhorchen.

The Signal is aiming to serve a need for the modern pace of life where everybody is busy, said Dinesh Narayanan, its co-founder and editor in an interview. \u201cPeople still want to keep up with what\u2019s happening in the world. They can read newspapers or multiple news outlets, but obviously they don\u2019t have time to do it,\u201d he said. The Noida-headquartered startup has been attempting to solve this with an eponymous newsletter and podcast where it curates, produces and discusses what they argue are the most important developments from the world of business, technology, economy and policy. The newsletter, which goes out six times a week, features nearly a dozen stories in each edition and deep dives into two to three major stories, offering additional context and commentary from a team of journalists who have previously worked at newsrooms including The Economic Times, The Quint, YourStory, The Morning Context and Reuters.

It has amassed over 38,000 subscribers, a base that includes several unicorn founders, lawmakers and policy executives. Its newsletter goes out at 8 AM and requires just five to seven minutes of reader time, said Narayanan. The startup, which plans to expand its coverage into more areas including sports and launch newer products, isn\u2019t currently charging its readers and listeners. Instead, most newsletters are currently backed by big name sponsors. Narayanan argued that a sponsor-backed model is the more sustainable way to monetize a news product in the country. \u201cEverybody talks about this total addressable market, right? Nobody really knows what exactly it is today because you have a population of probably about 150-200 million people who can afford to pay. There are so many avenues available to people which is giving them free news. It is a very small sliver of the audience which would actually pay,\u201d he said. \u201cSo some of them would be paying because it\u2019s good journalism, some of them would be paying because they give exactly the amount of news which they want, some of them would be paying for the depth of content. I think the existing players are already competing for this rather small pie.\u201d Each Saturday, Signal publishes original stories in a newsletter called The Intersection. The Signal, whose most other founding members including Venkat Ananth and Patanjali Pahwa are also journalists, is the latest independent media venture in the South Asian nation, which is the one of the world\u2019s largest news markets. The founding team also includes ex-Google India public policy official Rajneil Kamath and Chinmay Bhogle, formerly of Times Internet, Star Sports and Tata Motors. Several journalists in the country have left their influential jobs at top media houses in recent years to build something of their own as they grow frustrated at attempting to bring systemic changes to the way legacy outlets work \u2013 or take inspiration from a similar flow in the U.S., where journalists have traditionally shown more entrepreneurial instincts. But unlike the U.S. and the UK, where several media venture founders have made successful exits, India is yet to demonstrate any. At the end of the day, the future of the Signal depends on the purchasing power per capita of the nation, Narayanan said. As the \u201cpurchasing power increases and the consumption patterns change, purely on that basis \u2026 exits and the size of exits are a function of that. It\u2019s a business. Yeah, so it is definitely tied to the fortunes of the country as a whole,\u201d he added. For now, that\u2019s not something The Signal needs to worry about. The startup said Monday it has raised a new funding round, but did not disclose the size. The Signal\u2019s angel investors include CRED\u2019s Miten Sampat, Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal, Unacademy co-founder Gaurav Munjal, Haptik co-founder Aakrit Vaish, media entrepreneur Parry Ravindranathan, Vue.ai founder Ashwini Asokan and DealStreetAsia founder and CEO Joji Philip Thomas. Investment fund LetsVenture led the round, while venture capital fund Capital A also participated in it, Narayanan said. Fintech-focused fund Rainmatter also invested in the round, according to a regulatory filing. (Narayanan and Rainmatter didn\u2019t comment on the fund\u2019s participation.) \u201cVenkat, Patanjali, Dinesh & Roshni P Nair have authored some of the most important stories in India tech over the past 5 years, and I am very excited to see them build The Signal as a way to enable readers make sense of it all,\u201d said Sampat. \u201cIndia, and eventually the world, needs an outlet that goes beyond newsflashes and gets deep into nuanced reportage through a mix of curation, original writing and new formats of sense-making.\u201d",pubDate:"2022-08-22 06:31:47",image_url:null,source_id:"techcrunch",country:["united states of america"],category:["health"],language:"english"},{title:"The future of fibre: How Maxis is breaking through with changing consumer behaviour",link:"https://soyacincau.com/2022/08/22/future-of-fibre-broadband-internet-maxis-breaking-through-with-changing-consumer-behaviour-arjun-varma-loh-keh-jiat/",keywords:["Digital Life","Sponsored","Telco","Fibre Broadband","home broadband","Maxis","Maxis Broadband"],creator:["Sponsored"],video_url:null,description:"This post is brought to you by Maxis.

Shifting [\u2026]",content:"This post is brought to you by Maxis. While the advent of digitalisation shifted consumer behaviour tremendously over the years, the pandemic event the world faced together helped to further accelerate this shift. Hybrid working became the new norm with more people opting to work from home and some education institutions creating virtual classrooms. Due to shifting consumer behaviours, the frequently performed activities have become streaming and web browsing. In fact, video streaming makes the bulk of Maxis\u2019 total network traffic, followed by browsing, social networking, instant messaging, VoIP, gaming, and shopping as more people are consuming entertainment from home. Not to mention that today\u2019s IoT devices are becoming smarter and more sophisticated, allowing a single product to perform multiple tasks. Meanwhile, digital services like video and game streaming are consuming more data as 4K resolution is becoming the default standard. However, it\u2019s the activity of using multiple apps at a time that\u2019s increasing the demand for higher bandwidth and seamless connectivity. \u201cIn the past two and half years, digital adoption by Malaysians in many ways, from the way we shop to how businesses equip themselves with digital capabilities and channels to reach more customers. We have also seen how quickly many sectors have moved into a hybrid mode of working and learning from home and on-site. We believe a lot of these new practices will remain as the new norm post-pandemic,\u201d says Loh Keh Jiat, Maxis\u2019 Chief Marketing Officer. There is a huge dependency to be connected in every way possible, whether at home or on the go. For Maxis, the convergence of mobile and home services is key, and its fibre propositions are playing a significant role in meeting the ever-growing demands for a great connectivity experience at home. Maxis\u2019 fibre offerings go as far back as 10 years ago. Following the implementation of the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing back in 2018, the industry had the opportunity to offer more choices at competitive prices to consumers and businesses. In a first mover advantage, Maxis led the market in new affordable home and business fibre broadband plans through its Fibrenation campaign, with packages up to 65% cheaper than what they had previously offered. \u201cThese new plans had essentially opened a new era of accessible and affordable fibre broadband for even more Malaysian homes and businesses. Today, the demands for Internet consumption have grown tremendously, and our focus has been on providing higher speeds and with greater affordability. Therefore, we started offering 300Mbps up to 800Mbps, even before the pandemic and today we are proud to have the widest fibre footprint which is a result of our own fibre infrastructure and wholesale partnerships,\u201d says Loh. According to Maxis, the fixed broadband segment remained relatively untapped with 65% of homes fiberised and less than 55% of those fiberised homes connected, at the end of 2021. In addition to its own fibre build, Maxis is serving more than 5 million premises. \u201cWe believe there is a great future for fixed broadband in Malaysia, with significant growth potential in this untapped market. Fibre is the best for connectivity for the home. For customers in locations that do not have fibre coverage, they can still enjoy connectivity via wireless broadband. For example, with Maxis Home 4G Wi-Fi, customers will be on our 4G network where they will be able to enjoy unlimited data for all services from work, learning and play. \u201cThey can also get unlimited data for all lines for the whole family by combining any of their mobile lines with the plan. With a Plug & Play, easy setup, customers will be able to connect instantly, with no installation required, and use multiple devices at once. All with the option to add on home devices with zero upfront on our easy device ownership programme, Zerolution,\u201d adds Loh. Currently, Maxis has a couple of projects under its belt like assisting with the Government\u2019s JENDELA plan, addressing how 4G can help to accelerate broadband availability to homes where fibre infrastructure is not yet available and continuing to evaluate the possibility of more partnerships with infrastructure manufacturers and vendors. \u201cMore and more of our customers are enjoying fibre connectivity and this is evident in the consistent growth of our fibre connections quarter on quarter. As of Q2 2022, we have 638,000 fibre and 4G wireless home broadband connections nationwide due to the strong adoption of our converged packages and wider deployment to underserved areas. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our broadband footprint to secondary towns, via both fibre and 4G to bring connectivity to even more Malaysians,\u201d said Loh. Maxis attributes its consistent growth in home connections to the success of Maxis Unlimited Postpaid and Fibre, where customers who are on Maxis Fibre have unlimited data on their postpaid lines, with a tremendous sign-up rate since its launch. \u201cWe continue to see very strong YoY growth in data usage and recorded all-time high utilisation of our converged network of mobile and fibre connectivity. What\u2019s interesting is that our fibre network now carries almost 2x more traffic than the mobile network. We believe this is closely linked to the shift in customer behaviour as mentioned and the expectation of service providers to offer more than just either mobile or fixed. And Maxis is here to provide that with the demand for converged connectivity continuing to rise,\u201d says Loh. Meanwhile, Arjun Varma, Head of Maxis Consumer, says that product innovation has been central to Maxis\u2019 efforts in offering an unmatched personalised experience for its customers. \u201cSurpassing the half-million subscriber mark was a significant milestone for us in our fibre journey, and we owe this to our sharp focus on innovation around services and home experience propositions, as well as a deep understanding of changing customer behaviour and needs. This had essentially translated into a simplified journey for our customers. For example, we make it very easy for customers to own their favourite home devices with initiatives such as our successful Zerolution programme,\u201d says Arjun. By listening to its customers, Maxis has designed relevant solutions, underpinned by its high-performing network. The outcome is plans catered to specific segments, such as the Maxis Family Plan which addresses the everyday needs of a family such as data, home internet, or accessibility to new devices. \u201cThese propositions have helped us create extreme relevance in the market. Our propositions are also built with our Rangkaian Kita Rangkaian Malaysia premise in mind, meaning that it caters to Malaysians from all walks of life-based on their diverse and unique requirements. As the digital world continues to evolve, we continue to listen to our customers and review trends in the market against our propositions to ensure we constantly innovate to bring as much value as possible,\u201d says Arjun. \u201cAnother differentiating factor is our fibre service through our dedicated Internet experts, Maxperts, who not only install routers but ensure that the Wi-Fi is optimised for the best connectivity experience for the home. We have dedicated staff, physically, over the phone and online, serving with our expertise, complemented with AI-powered chatbots to serve customers 24-7,\u201d added Arjun. Loh says that Maxis has big ambitions in expanding its fibre footprint to bring affordable and high-speed connectivity to every home and business premise in Malaysia through building its own fibre network as well as developing partnerships with other access providers in the market. \u201cFor our own fibre build, we will have approximately 400k premise passes to be rolled out over the next 12-18 months as part of JENDELA, including in Tier 2 and 3 areas, which will bring high-speed broadband access to families living in non-urban areas in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Perlis, Kedah, Penang, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Johor, as well as the East Coast regions, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang. \u201cWe also build fibre networks for enterprises and offer a wide range of business fibre connectivity solutions for a truly converged experience. With an expanded fibre footprint, we will be able to further support more people, businesses, and the government in a rapidly evolving digital economy, as well as the nation\u2019s digitalisation agenda,\u201d says Loh. \u201cThere is a promising future for fibre, as both residential customers and businesses rely heavily on communications, video conferencing and video streaming. For Maxis, we are already playing a key role as a catalyst for digitalisation for individuals, businesses and the nation through our connectivity and digital solutions. \u201cWith our \u2018all-ways\u2019 connected proposition, we are committed to bringing together the best of technologies to enable people, businesses, and the nation to always be ahead in a changing world,\u201d concluded Loh.

Khandu, on behalf of the state government and the people, welcomed Gopichand and expressed gratitude for inaugurating the tournament. "Your mere presence in the beginning of the tournament is a huge encouragement and inspiration for our young shuttlers as for them you are the real star," Khandu said during the simple opening ceremony. He advised the participants not to worry about the results but give their best to each and every game they play. "Winning or losing is not as important as participation and giving it your best shot. Keep up the spirit of sportsmanship \u2013 win with humility and lose with dignity," he said. Talking about the overall sporting scenario of the country, Khandu credited the supportive and proactive role of the central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have catapulted India as a major sporting nation in the international arena. He cited the medal winning performances of Indian athletes in the last Olympic Games and the recently held Commonwealth Games. "Last 7-8 years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the performance of our sportspersons of all fields. Arunachal Pradesh, as a small state, too has seen its sportspersons shining at various levels," he observed. While recalling the role of his late father and former Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu, in whose memory the annual tournament is held, Khandu said the state government is committed to provide all facilities to budding sportspersons both in infrastructure and opportunities. He informed that since 2016, players from the state have bagged 314 Gold, 212 Silver and 277 Bronze medals in various recognized international, national and zonal games. "We are building world class infra like indoor and outdoor stadiums. One sports academy is being made functional in eastern Arunachal. We have approved construction of stadium in Tirap district. The work on stadiums at Aalo, Tezu and Chimpu is being reviewed regularly for early completion," he revealed. Appreciating ASBA for its relentless efforts to provide facilities to young shuttlers of the state, Khandu insisted that the 6 court badminton facility being developed here be completed as early as possible. "I request the department concerned to complete the 6-court facility at the earliest and hand it over to ASBA to facilitate conduction of events and trainings," he said. The weeklong tournament will consist of 26 events with nearly 300 players including 69 women players.

The wholesale price-based inflation eased to a five-month low of 13.93% in July on easing prices of food articles and manufactured products. Inflation in food articles in July eased to 10.77% from 14.39 per cent in June. .

The company has been running without a duly constituted board since the first one was inaugurated in 2013 and dissolved shortly after. Speaking at the weekend, at the virtual inauguration of a new 10-man board for NELMCO in Abuja, Osinbajo stressed that the inauguration marked an important milestone in the bid to resolve the liabilities relating to tariff shortfalls in the power sector (specifically for Distribution Companies), and to provide a veritable mechanism for managing the very dynamic nature of the liquidity challenges of the power sector in Nigeria. According to him, \u201cthis ceremony formally brings on board the invaluable skills and experience of notable and highly respected personalities as members of the Board of NELMCO.\u201d On what was expected from the new board, the vice president told members that, \u201cas a board, you are expected to make conscious and deliberate efforts to develop appropriate strategies to facilitate the successful conclusion of the outstanding pre-privatisation issues of the defunct PHCN, and ensure an effective implementation of NELMCO\u2019s additional mandate to resolve the tariff shortfall problems of the Electricity Distribution Companies. \u201cIn view of the challenges ahead, you are expected to draw extensively on our experience over the years, to continue to give credence to the Federal Government of Nigeria\u2019s economic development programme in a transparent, sustainable, credible and acceptable manner. \u201cThe Board is required to take appropriate steps to also ensure that the interests of the various segments of our society, particularly the ordinary citizens, are protected in the implementation of NELMCO\u2019s mandate.\u201d Commenting on the board\u2019s mandate, Osinbajo charged members to diligently carry out the responsibilities assigned to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association (MEMART) of the Company. Some of the provisions of the MEMART of the company include: To assume and administer the stranded debts of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Plc pursuant to the provisions of Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005. To manage post-privatisation liabilities in the power sector as may be directed by the National Council on Privatisation or any authorised agency of the federal government from time to time in line with the power sector reform act 2005. Responding on behalf of the members, the Board Chairperson and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, assured the vice president of the board\u2019s preparedness to ensure quick resolution of tariff shortfalls and related issues in the power sector in the most efficient manner. Other members of the board include the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu; Director General of Bureau for Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr. Alex Okoh; Director General of Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha; Managing Director of NELMCO, Mr. Bayo Fagbemi and Mr. Muhammad Aliyu Jumma\u2019a.

In a related development, the BPE Director General, Mr. Alex Okoh, has said the take-over of four electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) namely that of Kaduna, Kano, Ibadan and Port Harcourt has been concluded successfully. Okoh, who disclosed this in a presentation made at a virtual meeting of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), added that the challenge in the takeover of the Benin Disco was being addressed. The NCP is chaired by the vice president who was represented at the meeting by Ahmed, who also doubles as the Vice Chairperson of the Council. In his report to the Council, the BPE DG also made a presentation on the concession of the Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant, inviting NCP to note steps taken by the Bureau to fast track the process.

Described as \"crowdsourced wisdom\" in the Gnosis whitepaper, prediction markets allow users to speculate on any event, sports, political, etc. and utilize user predictions to aggregate information about future events. Moreover, Gnosis is creating an infrastructure layer to enable developers to build their own prediction market apps. The Gnosis protocol has a dual token system, with GNO and OWL tokens to power the platform. Read on for relevant information about the Gnosis protocol and an extensive breakdown of its technology, and get a quick tutorial on why, where, and how to buy Gnosis online in a few simple steps. Let\u2019s get right to it!  What Is Gnosis Gnosis homepage Gnosis is a permissionless, decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum blockchain. It's an open-source platform where users can speculate and bet on any event, news, or arbitrary outcome. Gnosis enables users to trade tokens representing event outcomes on an open market. As the events unfold, and the outcome becomes clear, Gnosis tokens gain or lose value depending on the user's prediction. The Gnosis protocol aims to establish the global standard in prediction markets and provide users with reliable forecasting tools. It provides an infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to function as forecasting tools, sources of information, and standards for predictive assets. Gnosis aggregates public opinion combined with data from AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents in an uncensored source to build an unbiased market for data collection and future estimates that could have applications in finance, government, and other sectors. GNO and OWL tokens power Gnosis. GNO is an ERC20 token used to reward Gnosis users. Gnosis tokens (GNO) are used to generate OWL tokens, the primary mode of payment on the platform. What Is Prediction Market To better understand how Gnosis works, we'll delineate a prediction market and how it works. Simply put, it's a market where users can place bets on future events. However, Gnosis has much more utility than placing bets on sports, news, or political events. Prediction markets collect information about the outcome of future events by incentivizing traders to update a data point accurately. Prediction markets take advantage of the wisdom of crowds, i.e., the belief that collective predictions of market participants are usually more accurate and balanced than that of a single expert. Traders bet on what they believe is the most likely outcome, thereby increasing or decreasing the price of that outcome. A decentralized prediction market is a prediction market operating through blockchain-based smart contracts that can self-execute to distribute payoffs without the control of any centralized authority. Prediction markets are effective as a prognostic tool for topics like climate change, epidemics, price forecasting, insurance, etc. They are also used in the financial sector in probabilistically determining the future prices of assets. How Does Gnosis Market Work Gnosis price page Gnosis comprises three separate development layers, such as: Gnosis Core Layer: It's the foundational layer that contains smart contracts for market mechanisms, outcome tokens, etc., on the Gnosis platform.Gnosis Service Layer: It's the platform's second layer that provides resources for consumer applications and implementing tools such as chatbots and stablecoins.Gnosis Application Layer: It's built on top of the Service and Core layers and consists of front-end tools such as apps, etc., that can be built by the Gnosis teams and third-party developers. Gnosis uses the following platforms to achieve its goals: The Apollo Network: It allows users to create their own tokens representing information, incentives, or ideas and a market for any arbitrary event where users can buy or sell positions to speculate on the outcome. Certain outcomes are more likely to happen, increasing the related tokens' value. Once the event has been finalized, the tokens representing the final outcome receive the total value of the bets, while the tokens representing a different outcome use their value.DutchX: A decentralized exchange where users can trade and auction off their tokens.Gnosis Safe: It's a cryptocurrency wallet and browser used to interact with the Ethereum DApps. It enables individuals and businesses to set up multi-signature wallets to store their digital assets securely. This Gnosis wallet interacts smoothly with most popular DeFi protocols and is available for Android and iOS or as a Chrome browser extension. Gnosis History The Gnosis protocol was co-founded by Martin K\xf6ppelmann and Stefan George in 2015. It was one of the first projects backed by Ethereum-focused incubator, Consensys. The company held an ICO in 2017 and raised over USD12.5 million by selling 4 percent of the token supply. The ICO was very popular, and the sale ended in less than 15 minutes. In late 2017, Gnosis' testnet Olympia was launched, and in 2018, Apollo, DutchX, and Gnosis Safe were launched. Gnosis (GNO) Tokenomics Gnosis uses two native tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO is an ERC-20 token, with a total supply of 10 million tokens created during the IC sale in April 2017. The OWL token is used to reward users who stake GNO tokens, with one OWL being equal to $1. The staking rewards depend on the lock-in period and the OWL tokens' supply. OWL tokens are also the preferred mode of payment on the platform. The GNO tokens' circulating supply is 2,579,589 tokens, and the total supply is 3,000,000 tokens.

Performance is unpredictable, and the past performance of Gnosis is no guarantee of its future performance.",content:"Gnosis is an open-source and decentralized prediction market platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. Described as \"crowdsourced wisdom\" in the Gnosis whitepaper, prediction markets allow users to speculate on any event, sports, political, etc. and utilize user predictions to aggregate information about future events. Moreover, Gnosis is creating an infrastructure layer to enable developers to build their own prediction market apps. The Gnosis protocol has a dual token system, with GNO and OWL tokens to power the platform. Read on for relevant information about the Gnosis protocol and an extensive breakdown of its technology, and get a quick tutorial on why, where, and how to buy Gnosis online in a few simple steps. Let\u2019s get right to it!  What Is Gnosis Gnosis homepage Gnosis is a permissionless, decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum blockchain. It's an open-source platform where users can speculate and bet on any event, news, or arbitrary outcome. Gnosis enables users to trade tokens representing event outcomes on an open market. As the events unfold, and the outcome becomes clear, Gnosis tokens gain or lose value depending on the user's prediction. The Gnosis protocol aims to establish the global standard in prediction markets and provide users with reliable forecasting tools. It provides an infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to function as forecasting tools, sources of information, and standards for predictive assets. Gnosis aggregates public opinion combined with data from AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents in an uncensored source to build an unbiased market for data collection and future estimates that could have applications in finance, government, and other sectors. GNO and OWL tokens power Gnosis. GNO is an ERC20 token used to reward Gnosis users. Gnosis tokens (GNO) are used to generate OWL tokens, the primary mode of payment on the platform. What Is Prediction Market To better understand how Gnosis works, we'll delineate a prediction market and how it works. Simply put, it's a market where users can place bets on future events. However, Gnosis has much more utility than placing bets on sports, news, or political events. Prediction markets collect information about the outcome of future events by incentivizing traders to update a data point accurately. Prediction markets take advantage of the wisdom of crowds, i.e., the belief that collective predictions of market participants are usually more accurate and balanced than that of a single expert. Traders bet on what they believe is the most likely outcome, thereby increasing or decreasing the price of that outcome. A decentralized prediction market is a prediction market operating through blockchain-based smart contracts that can self-execute to distribute payoffs without the control of any centralized authority. Prediction markets are effective as a prognostic tool for topics like climate change, epidemics, price forecasting, insurance, etc. They are also used in the financial sector in probabilistically determining the future prices of assets. How Does Gnosis Market Work Gnosis price page Gnosis comprises three separate development layers, such as: Gnosis Core Layer: It's the foundational layer that contains smart contracts for market mechanisms, outcome tokens, etc., on the Gnosis platform.Gnosis Service Layer: It's the platform's second layer that provides resources for consumer applications and implementing tools such as chatbots and stablecoins.Gnosis Application Layer: It's built on top of the Service and Core layers and consists of front-end tools such as apps, etc., that can be built by the Gnosis teams and third-party developers. Gnosis uses the following platforms to achieve its goals: The Apollo Network: It allows users to create their own tokens representing information, incentives, or ideas and a market for any arbitrary event where users can buy or sell positions to speculate on the outcome. Certain outcomes are more likely to happen, increasing the related tokens' value. Once the event has been finalized, the tokens representing the final outcome receive the total value of the bets, while the tokens representing a different outcome use their value.DutchX: A decentralized exchange where users can trade and auction off their tokens.Gnosis Safe: It's a cryptocurrency wallet and browser used to interact with the Ethereum DApps. It enables individuals and businesses to set up multi-signature wallets to store their digital assets securely. This Gnosis wallet interacts smoothly with most popular DeFi protocols and is available for Android and iOS or as a Chrome browser extension. Gnosis History The Gnosis protocol was co-founded by Martin K\xf6ppelmann and Stefan George in 2015. It was one of the first projects backed by Ethereum-focused incubator, Consensys. The company held an ICO in 2017 and raised over USD12.5 million by selling 4 percent of the token supply. The ICO was very popular, and the sale ended in less than 15 minutes. In late 2017, Gnosis' testnet Olympia was launched, and in 2018, Apollo, DutchX, and Gnosis Safe were launched. Gnosis (GNO) Tokenomics Gnosis uses two native tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO is an ERC-20 token, with a total supply of 10 million tokens created during the IC sale in April 2017. The OWL token is used to reward users who stake GNO tokens, with one OWL being equal to $1. The staking rewards depend on the lock-in period and the OWL tokens' supply. OWL tokens are also the preferred mode of payment on the platform. The GNO tokens' circulating supply is 2,579,589 tokens, and the total supply is 3,000,000 tokens.

The post The Best Mechanical Keyboards If You\u2019re Chasing That Clickety-Clack appeared first on Kotaku Australia.",content:"If you want everyone to know you\u2019re busy, tapping away at your mechanical gaming keyboard is one way to do it. Aside from being notoriously clicky while typing, mechanical keyboards are the ultimate choice for PC users. Once you\u2019ve settled on your mouse , mouse pad , headset and cable organisers , it\u2019s time to start thinking about that backlit keyboard that will complete your gaming set-up . Table of Contents A mechanical keyboard is a popular and classic choice that features raised, spring loaded keys. Unlike membrane keyboards, which are commonly seen on laptops, typing on its keys tends to be much louder but more accurate, making it a much more efficient choice for first-person shooters such as Fortnite or Apex Legends . You see, a mechanical keyboard uses high-quality mechanical switches (hence the name), instead of relying on cheap, rubber dome switches. Overall, they\u2019re more responsive and durable, but heavier to cart around. However, they\u2019re also built to last years, in comparison to membrane keyboards that tend to wear down faster. Since we gamers are big on personalisation, an added bonus for mechanical keyboards is their customisation potential. It\u2019s usually easy to remove its keys and replace them with colourful, nicer-looking ones. But, keep in mind that mechanical keyboards can be harder to clean thanks to the raised keys, as well as heavier, louder and more expensive. The cleaning isn\u2019t hard to solve if you have a cordless air duster , though. Looks aside, figuring out which mechanical keyboard to take home is always a doozy. We think that the best place to start is to ask yourself whether you want a wired or wireless one. Most options on the market tend to be wired, which isn\u2019t a problem for most with stationary PC set-ups. But those of you who use a laptop with a limited number of USB ports might want to consider a wireless keyboard instead. Regardless of your preference, make sure you check on the keyboard\u2019s compatibility with your computer before proceeding to checkout. Next you\u2019ll want to consider what size keyboard you want. Each keyboard size differs in its layout, and ultimately, the number of keys available. While a full-sized keyboard can save you from making this decision, you might want a smaller board due to limited desk space. Most tend to agree that a tenkeyless keyboard is a perfect choice. It sports 87 keys, is compact and comfortable and typically includes all of the necessary keys you need to perform basic computer actions. However, tenkeyless keyboards notably lack a number pad, which may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. Another popular size is known as a 60% keyboard . These keyboards are sometimes referred to as \u201cmini keyboards\u201d and are quite common in the wild thanks to their easy customisation capabilities. The only catch is that they tend to lack not just the numpad, but function keys, home cluster and arrow keys. Once you\u2019ve settled on your size, consider whether you want a tactile or linear keyboard. Generally speaking, tactile keyboards are those loud ones you hear office workers drumming their fingers against and are distinguished by the small bump you feel when you press down on its keys. Meanwhile, linear keyboards are named for the smooth, up/down movement it takes the press the switches. They\u2019re much quieter than tactile keyboards and require less effort to press the keys. Some gamers prefer softer, light touch keys, that allow them to glide over the board to enter any commands without a second thought. If you opt for a linear keyboard, you won\u2019t need to press down hard on its keys, whereas you would have to if you\u2019re using a tactile one. From there, you might have noticed the word \u201cCherry MX Switch\u201d included in the description of various keyboards you\u2019ve been researching. If this concept has you scratching your head, we\u2019ve gone ahead and broken it down for you: One of the last things you\u2019ll want to pay attention to is your keyboard\u2019s rollover capability a.k.a how many keys can your keyboard recognise at one time. Most keyboards tend to recognise a maximum of three key combinations at the same time, whereas when you\u2019re gaming you might need to press four or more. Other things you can keep in mind are whether that keyboard features any wrist rests that offer ergonomic support or if it comes with a mouse as a bundle. We always love getting more bang for our buck. This mechanical keyboard has an insane 13,300 reviews on Amazon and we think that sums itself up as one of the best choices you can get your Cheetos-covered mitts on. Not only is it full-sized, linear and with Cherry MX Red switches, but it also has an ergonomic wrist rest for you to lean on during cutscenes. Some reviewers have remarked that it\u2019s a fantastic tactile choice with the right amount of resistance and the perfect typing angle. Where to buy Amazon ($299.12) | jw ($219) Those who love to mix business with pleasure will appreciate a mechanical keyboard that features a brown switch, much like this Logitech one. While it\u2019s all well and good to own a gaming-exclusive keyboard, it does ease the ol\u2019 bank account to just get one that can do it all. This full-sized mechanical keyboard is perfect for getting work done during daylight before switching over to RGB-lit gaming at night. Its tactile keys will let you tap away loud and proud at full speed. Where to buy Amazon ($123) | Bing Lee ($129) | eBay ($168) Our Editor David reviewed this HyperX keyboard late last year and while it lacks some bells and whistles, this HyperX tenkeyless keyboard has everything you\u2019d want from a gaming keyboard. This sturdy board is made from aircraft-grade aluminium, which basically means it\u2019s strong and heavy enough to withstand some aggressive tapping if you\u2019re in the middle of a Halo Infinite match. This gaming keyboard features X1 Cherry Red switches which are perfect for letting your fingers slide from one key to another or if you\u2019re just a trigger-happy son-of-a-bitch. However, you can also get a stiffer Blue or Aqua switch if you prefer. We\u2019re also a fan of its three adjustable angles, so you can type to your comfort and ditch that pesky carpal tunnel syndrome. Where to buy Amazon ($134) | eBay ($151.90) | Mwave ($179) If you\u2019d prefer a much more compact keyboard, you might want to consider something in the 60% mechanical range. Our king, David, also reviewed this particular keyboard earlier this year. Smaller than a tenkeyless keyboard, a 60% sized keyboard lops off the number pad and arrow keys as well as function-specific buttons. While it might take some time to get used to navigating without arrow keys, this gaming keyboard is ideal if you have limited desk space. But don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s a game you\u2019re playing that relies on arrow keys since you can use the letters J, K, L and I to move around. Although, you will have to get used to sitting your pinky on the function key. On the plus side, this Razer board has linear red switches which make for a silent, effortless typing style that shouldn\u2019t piss off anybody trying to watch TV nearby. Where to buy Amazon ($159) | Bing Lee ($159) | eBay ($139) If you\u2019d prefer a wireless mechanical gaming keyboard, you can grab this one by Redragon. This wireless keyboard features brown switches, which are ideal for typing or gaming, so it\u2019ll get plenty of use for both work and play. Its smaller size also makes it a great portable option. So if you like to do a lot of gaming on a laptop, but can\u2019t stand its membrane keys, then connect this tenkeyless keyboard via Bluetooth, so you can transform into a stealthy sniper post-work. It\u2019s also just a refreshing spin on the classic black style in case you\u2019re a fan of a lighter and brighter look .

Hatchbacks are the backbone of personal transport in India making up 38% of total car sales but SUVs, with their sporty body styles and in-car connectivity features, took the lead last fiscal year with around a 40% share. India\'s biggest carmaker hopes to arrest this trend by targeting young buyers in large cities with its new Alto which is bigger than its predecessor, has a larger, one litre engine and more features, said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer, marketing and sales. "We have a bigger, more powerful car ... and geographically also we are expanding the base," Srivastava told Reuters ahead of the car\'s launch on Thursday. He said about 65% of Alto\'s sales come from smaller cities but with the new model Maruti is targeting buyers in bigger cities between the age of 25 years and 35 years. Maruti, majority-owned by Japan\'s Suzuki Motor Corp, dominates the entry-level, small car segment in India with models like the Alto, which has been a top-seller in the country for several years. But with high inflation and other factors pushing up car prices, growth of small cars has slowed. "The affordability in this segment has come down for various reasons. The sensitivity to price rises is much higher," he said, adding that Alto is the first car for many buyers - a cost-conscious segment that Maruti will continue to target. "This segment will play a very important role in the future", Srivastava said, adding that first time buyers make up 50% of cars sold in the country. Entry-level cars like Alto currently make up about 15% of Maruti\'s total annual sales and Srivastava expects this to grow with the new model. Maruti expects total car sales in India to rise to about 3.7 million this year from about 3.1 million last fiscal year, he said. But this could be impacted by high inflation and material costs, supply chain disruptions, as well as new regulations.',pubDate:"2022-08-22 06:41:57",image_url:"https://images.carandbike.com/cms/articles/3201277/articles/3201365/Maruti_Suzuki_Swift_2_2022_08_13_T15_22_50_463_Z_7ba8ef8db4.jpeg",source_id:"carandbike",country:["india"],category:["business"],language:"english"}],ln=[{title:"Xinhua Silk Road: E.China Jiangxi Nanchang county holds promotional event to show charm, attract investment",link:"https://www.prnewswire.com:443/news-releases/xinhua-silk-road-echina-jiangxi-nanchang-county-holds-promotional-event-to-show-charm-attract-investment-301609726.html",keywords:["Computer & Electronics","Publishing & Information Services","CPR","PUB"],creator:null,video_url:null,description:"BEIJING, Aug. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Nanchang county in east China's Jiangxi province recently kicked off its \"lotus festival\", an annual economic, trade and cultural event to promote business environment and attract investment.

Ads in the Apple Maps app would not be the traditional banner ads that you see on websites but rather paid search results, the report said. For example, a fast food chain could pay Apple to appear near the top of the results when a user searches for \u201cburgers\u201d or \u201cfries\u201d. Many similar apps already offer search ads, including Google Maps, Waze, and Yelp. Apple already displays search ads in the App Store, allowing developers to pay to promote their apps to users who search for relevant keywords. The tech giant is also planning to show ads in the App Store\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d tab and in a new \u201cYou Might Also Like\u201d section at the bottom of app listings, while banner ads are displayed in Apple\u2019s News and Stocks apps.

Shares of Socar rose 1.25% from its IPO price of 28,000 won ($21.10) in the initial minutes of the debut, before tumbling to 26,300 won and giving the firm a market cap of $642 million. Last week, Socar cut its targeted IPO offering to 102 billion won ($78.1 million), giving the car-sharing company a valuation of 966.5 billion won ($731 million) before the start of trading. Socar\u2019s debut comes amid a sluggish period in the IPO market in South Korea that has prompted a series of Korean companies to delay their listing plans. Analysts attributed the muted performance of Socar\u2019s debut day to an expensive valuation and slowdown in the IPO market that is reeling from the global economic downturn. Jaeuk Park, CEO of Socar, told TechCrunch earlier that the company was pushing ahead with its listing plans because it was confident in its performance and expected to generate both operating profits and net profits by the end of this year. Rather than waiting for the stock market to recover for a higher valuation for the next two to three years, he said, the Korean mobility startup prioritized investment in organic/ inorganic growth with the IPO proceeds. \u201cFirst off, Socar\u2019s growth is faster than expected in the face of re-opening [after the COVID-19 pandemic],\u201d Park said. \u201cThe stock market is expected to be tough for the time being, but the mobility industry will grow rapidly that we can\u2019t miss this critical time; we will focus on accelerating mergers and acquisitions and investments in new businesses and technology.\u201d The company plans to beef up its services and geographic expansion efforts via acquisitions to become a mobility super-app with the goal of posting 1 trillion won ($748 million) of revenue by 2025, up from 289 billion won last year, Park continued. It aims to reach 30% or more annual revenue growth by 2025, he added. Socar, the first and only unicorn mobility startup in South Korea, aims to become the first listed profitable unicorn company, Park noted. Socar, backed by SoftBank, and Korean strategic investor SK Inc, entered the unicorn club with roughly 183.2 billion won ($150 million) funding at a 1.3 trillion won (approximately $1 billion) in March from Lotte Rental, the rental car unit of South Korean Lotte Group. The startup raised a total of 379.7 billion won ($ 284.2million) since its inception in 2011 before its IPO. The company\u2019s major shareholders, including SoftBank, SK Inc, Lotte Rental and Altos Ventures, will hold their stake since they agreed to a lock-up period of up to six months. The 11-year-old firm, which started the car-sharing service with 100 rental cars in Jeju, now manages a fleet of more than 19,000 vehicles across the country, offering services, including car-sharing, car-hailing, electric bicycle rental, parking, vehicle management and vehicle maintenance. It will launch its transportation super-app later this year, providing all-in-one mobility services. Additionally, Socar is building an ecosystem for future mobility, including an autonomous driving platform, charging stations service for electric cars and micro-mobility. Park said in an interview that Socar wants to enter the Southeast Asia market with its new business, fleet management system (FMS) B2B SaaS service that it plans to begin selling later in the fourth quarter of this year. Socar, based on its 19,000 vehicles, has built the FMS technology that uses data such as vehicle location and surroundings to support effective monitoring and control systems, providing accurate information to drivers and management servers. \u201cFMS is different from car-sharing, which has been Socar\u2019s flagship business for the past ten years, and if stabilized, it is a B2B SaaS that guarantees a high-profit ratio,\u201d Park said. Socar claims that the company has captured about 80% of the market share in South Korea, with more than 11.4 million users and 1.4 million monthly active users this year. The Korean car-hailing company has set up Socar Malaysia, a 79% stake owned by SK Inc, and launched services in Malaysia in 2018 and Indonesia in 2020. Socar was founded in 2011 by Lee Jae-woong, who co-founded South Korea\u2019s largest internet portal operator Daum Communications; Daum merged into Kakao in 2014. Jaeuk Park, a serial entrepreneur, who founded VCNC, an operator messaging app for couples called Between, in 2011, sold VCNC to Socar in 2018. After the sale of VCNC, Park joined Socar\u2019s chief strategy officer (CSO) to lead Socar\u2019s ride-hailing business Tada and took on the chief executive officer (CEO) in 2020 after Lee stepped down. Korean game maker Krafton acquired VCNC\u2019s messaging app unit in May 2021, while Viva Republica, a Korean financial super app Toss operator, bought a 60% stake in Tada , the ride-hailing business of VCNC, for an undisclosed amount in October last year. Meanwhile, South Korea\u2019s TMap Mobility, whose investors include Uber Technologies and SK Inc\u2019s investment firm SK Square, said Monday it has raised $149.2 million (200 billion won) from strategic investor KB Bank. Another Korean car-hailing platform Kakao Mobility, which also had planned an IPO between 2022 and 2023, said last week it has terminated its sale talk with Korean private equity firm MBK Partners.",pubDate:"2022-08-22 07:00:06",image_url:null,source_id:"techcrunch",country:["united states of america"],category:["technology"],language:"english"},{title:"Report: Newcastle now pushing to sign \xa330m Pogba-like talent Marcelo Bielsa wanted at Leeds",link:"https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2022/08/22/report-newcastle-pushing-to-sign-30m-pogba-like-talent-bielsa-wanted-at-leeds/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=report-newcastle-pushing-to-sign-30m-pogba-like-talent-bielsa-wanted-at-leeds",keywords:["Borussia Monchengladbach","Competitions","Football","Leeds United","Newcastle United","Premier League","Teams","manu kone"],creator:["Dylan Walsh"],video_url:null,description:"Newcastle United are now reportedly pushing to sign Borussia Monchengladbach star Manu Kone, a player Marcelo Bielsa was once desperate to have at Leeds United....

According to L\u2019Equipe via GFFN , the Magpies are intent on signing the 21-year-old France international, with Eddie Howe\u2019s side willing to spend as much as \u20ac35m (\xa330m) to secure the midfielder\u2019s services this summer, with Kone last season establishing himself as one of the Bundesliga\u2019s most exciting talents. The youngster has come a long way in the last 12 months, with Kone becoming a regular for Gladbach last season and becoming a France U-21 international, with Leeds seemingly missing out on a diamond following reports in 2020 that Bielsa was eager to sign the midfielder after the Whites promotion back to the Premier League. Now, it appears that Newcastle could sign Kone two years after Leeds missed out on the youngster, who TuttoMerctoWeb once likened to Juventus star Paul Pogba given how versatile the Bundesliga star is in the midfielder and his physical frame. Newcastle and Leeds are now both rushing to try and sign 'terrific' \xa36m midfielder Newcastle want to sign Manchester United talent, Paratici and Orta reluctant to pay \xa314m As per L\u2019Equipe, whilst a formal offer is yet to be made, late activity in the window could see Newcastle table a bid for Kone, who would be an excellent addition to the Toon\u2019s squad and another piece of Howe\u2019s long-term vision for the northeast side, who this weekend secured an incredible 3-3 draw against English champions Manchester City. Indeed, whilst Kone would be an expensive outlay for Newcastle, pairing the midfielder alongside Bruno Guimaraes could form an excellent spine for the Magpies going forward, and the midfielder himself could be very open to a move to the Premier League with Howe\u2019s side. Newcastle should be pushing hard to sign Kone this summer Photo by Christian Verheyen/Borussia Moenchengladbach via Getty Images Newcastle\u2019s business this summer has been oddly underwhelming despite the massive improvements the likes of Nick Pope and Sven Botman have already made to the team this season, and adding Kone to the mix could complete an outstanding window of business for the English side. Whilst Kone is only 21, the midfielder has the potential to become a key staple for Newcastle in the years to come, and the youngster could be an ideal signing that will excite supporters this season, especially alongside Guimaraes in the centre of the Magpies park.

This is Money 08:08 Summer lethargy weighs on sentiment Head of markets at interactive investor Richard Hunter: \'The recent rally ran out of steam as investors braced for the latest Federal Reserve pronouncements later this week. \'The likely highlight of the annual Jackson Hole symposium will be a speech from Fed Chair Powell, where the committee\u2019s latest thinking is likely to be unveiled. While no material change is expected from the current path of interest rate rises, there may be an update on emerging economic data which is suggesting that the hikes already undertaken are beginning to have an impact. \'That being said, there have also been lagging indicators such as the latest jobs numbers and inflation print which suggest that the economy remains robust enough to withstand the current round of rises, even though this will not become apparent until after the event, given the trailing nature of most economic data. \'Therein lies the difficulty of the Fed\u2019s current strategy. It remains committed to tackling inflation head on, but is also aware that an overtightening of the screws could lead the world\u2019s largest economy into a slowdown. At the same time, persistent inflation is likely to weigh on corporate margins although the recent reporting season showed that many companies are holding up relatively well. \'The current delicacy of this balancing act was enough to put the brakes on a recently recovering Wall Street, with each of the major indices ending the week on a negative note. In the year to date, the Dow Jones is now down by 7%, while the S&P500 and Nasdaq have shed 11% and 19% respectively. \'Asian markets were mixed despite the easing of financial conditions in China, where the central bank is aiming to encourage lending in an effort to boost an ailing economy. Quite apart from the impact of the latest Covid-19 variant which has resulted in several lockdowns, the property market remains under severe pressure and there was also a power shortage in a key manufacturing region. \'The general summer lethargy also weighed on sentiment in UK markets, where further monetary tightening is also likely to continue. The more recent strength of the US Dollar as a haven investment has pulled the rug from sterling, which has had the impact of underpinning the premier index which derives much of its income from overseas, thus making those earnings more valuable in translation. The FTSE100 remains up by 2% in the year to date despite a tepid opening today, although the FTSE250, a more representative barometer of the UK economy as a whole, continues its weakness and has lost 15.5% so far this year. \'In early exchanges, a further leg down in the oil price on demand concerns weighed on BP and Shell, with some weakness in recovery stocks such as International Consolidated Airlines offset slightly by some tentative buying within defensives.\' 07:48 Bosses at UK\'s biggest listed companies saw average pay soar to \xa33.41m last year Bosses at the UK\'s biggest listed companies saw their average pay soar to \xa33.41million last year, according to figures.

The post The Best Mechanical Keyboards If You\u2019re Chasing That Clickety-Clack appeared first on Kotaku Australia.",content:"If you want everyone to know you\u2019re busy, tapping away at your mechanical gaming keyboard is one way to do it. Aside from being notoriously clicky while typing, mechanical keyboards are the ultimate choice for PC users. Once you\u2019ve settled on your mouse , mouse pad , headset and cable organisers , it\u2019s time to start thinking about that backlit keyboard that will complete your gaming set-up . Table of Contents A mechanical keyboard is a popular and classic choice that features raised, spring loaded keys. Unlike membrane keyboards, which are commonly seen on laptops, typing on its keys tends to be much louder but more accurate, making it a much more efficient choice for first-person shooters such as Fortnite or Apex Legends . You see, a mechanical keyboard uses high-quality mechanical switches (hence the name), instead of relying on cheap, rubber dome switches. Overall, they\u2019re more responsive and durable, but heavier to cart around. However, they\u2019re also built to last years, in comparison to membrane keyboards that tend to wear down faster. Since we gamers are big on personalisation, an added bonus for mechanical keyboards is their customisation potential. It\u2019s usually easy to remove its keys and replace them with colourful, nicer-looking ones. But, keep in mind that mechanical keyboards can be harder to clean thanks to the raised keys, as well as heavier, louder and more expensive. The cleaning isn\u2019t hard to solve if you have a cordless air duster , though. Looks aside, figuring out which mechanical keyboard to take home is always a doozy. We think that the best place to start is to ask yourself whether you want a wired or wireless one. Most options on the market tend to be wired, which isn\u2019t a problem for most with stationary PC set-ups. But those of you who use a laptop with a limited number of USB ports might want to consider a wireless keyboard instead. Regardless of your preference, make sure you check on the keyboard\u2019s compatibility with your computer before proceeding to checkout. Next you\u2019ll want to consider what size keyboard you want. Each keyboard size differs in its layout, and ultimately, the number of keys available. While a full-sized keyboard can save you from making this decision, you might want a smaller board due to limited desk space. Most tend to agree that a tenkeyless keyboard is a perfect choice. It sports 87 keys, is compact and comfortable and typically includes all of the necessary keys you need to perform basic computer actions. However, tenkeyless keyboards notably lack a number pad, which may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. Another popular size is known as a 60% keyboard . These keyboards are sometimes referred to as \u201cmini keyboards\u201d and are quite common in the wild thanks to their easy customisation capabilities. The only catch is that they tend to lack not just the numpad, but function keys, home cluster and arrow keys. Once you\u2019ve settled on your size, consider whether you want a tactile or linear keyboard. Generally speaking, tactile keyboards are those loud ones you hear office workers drumming their fingers against and are distinguished by the small bump you feel when you press down on its keys. Meanwhile, linear keyboards are named for the smooth, up/down movement it takes the press the switches. They\u2019re much quieter than tactile keyboards and require less effort to press the keys. Some gamers prefer softer, light touch keys, that allow them to glide over the board to enter any commands without a second thought. If you opt for a linear keyboard, you won\u2019t need to press down hard on its keys, whereas you would have to if you\u2019re using a tactile one. From there, you might have noticed the word \u201cCherry MX Switch\u201d included in the description of various keyboards you\u2019ve been researching. If this concept has you scratching your head, we\u2019ve gone ahead and broken it down for you: One of the last things you\u2019ll want to pay attention to is your keyboard\u2019s rollover capability a.k.a how many keys can your keyboard recognise at one time. Most keyboards tend to recognise a maximum of three key combinations at the same time, whereas when you\u2019re gaming you might need to press four or more. Other things you can keep in mind are whether that keyboard features any wrist rests that offer ergonomic support or if it comes with a mouse as a bundle. We always love getting more bang for our buck. This mechanical keyboard has an insane 13,300 reviews on Amazon and we think that sums itself up as one of the best choices you can get your Cheetos-covered mitts on. Not only is it full-sized, linear and with Cherry MX Red switches, but it also has an ergonomic wrist rest for you to lean on during cutscenes. Some reviewers have remarked that it\u2019s a fantastic tactile choice with the right amount of resistance and the perfect typing angle. Where to buy Amazon ($299.12) | jw ($219) Those who love to mix business with pleasure will appreciate a mechanical keyboard that features a brown switch, much like this Logitech one. While it\u2019s all well and good to own a gaming-exclusive keyboard, it does ease the ol\u2019 bank account to just get one that can do it all. This full-sized mechanical keyboard is perfect for getting work done during daylight before switching over to RGB-lit gaming at night. Its tactile keys will let you tap away loud and proud at full speed. Where to buy Amazon ($123) | Bing Lee ($129) | eBay ($168) Our Editor David reviewed this HyperX keyboard late last year and while it lacks some bells and whistles, this HyperX tenkeyless keyboard has everything you\u2019d want from a gaming keyboard. This sturdy board is made from aircraft-grade aluminium, which basically means it\u2019s strong and heavy enough to withstand some aggressive tapping if you\u2019re in the middle of a Halo Infinite match. This gaming keyboard features X1 Cherry Red switches which are perfect for letting your fingers slide from one key to another or if you\u2019re just a trigger-happy son-of-a-bitch. However, you can also get a stiffer Blue or Aqua switch if you prefer. We\u2019re also a fan of its three adjustable angles, so you can type to your comfort and ditch that pesky carpal tunnel syndrome. Where to buy Amazon ($134) | eBay ($151.90) | Mwave ($179) If you\u2019d prefer a much more compact keyboard, you might want to consider something in the 60% mechanical range. Our king, David, also reviewed this particular keyboard earlier this year. Smaller than a tenkeyless keyboard, a 60% sized keyboard lops off the number pad and arrow keys as well as function-specific buttons. While it might take some time to get used to navigating without arrow keys, this gaming keyboard is ideal if you have limited desk space. But don\u2019t worry if there\u2019s a game you\u2019re playing that relies on arrow keys since you can use the letters J, K, L and I to move around. Although, you will have to get used to sitting your pinky on the function key. On the plus side, this Razer board has linear red switches which make for a silent, effortless typing style that shouldn\u2019t piss off anybody trying to watch TV nearby. Where to buy Amazon ($159) | Bing Lee ($159) | eBay ($139) If you\u2019d prefer a wireless mechanical gaming keyboard, you can grab this one by Redragon. This wireless keyboard features brown switches, which are ideal for typing or gaming, so it\u2019ll get plenty of use for both work and play. Its smaller size also makes it a great portable option. So if you like to do a lot of gaming on a laptop, but can\u2019t stand its membrane keys, then connect this tenkeyless keyboard via Bluetooth, so you can transform into a stealthy sniper post-work. It\u2019s also just a refreshing spin on the classic black style in case you\u2019re a fan of a lighter and brighter look .

According to the physician, the prolonged use of whitening toothpaste will eventually make teeth colour to turn yellow. In a video shared on his Instagram page, @tolubinutu, the UK-based health expert explained that whitening toothpaste work by removing stains on the surface of our teeth. The stains, he said, could be due to anything ranging from our foods to drinks. He added that chronic coffee drinkers and smokers are also prone to developing teeth stains. He said, \u201cThe reason whitening toothpaste can remove these stains better than regular toothpaste is that whitening toothpaste is more abrasive. \u201cThis means that they have \u2018crunchy\u2019 particles that can abrade and remove those stubborn stains on the teeth.\u201d He, however, noted that whitening toothpaste works like sandpaper and according to him, that is where the problem arises. \u201cBecause of their abrasiveness, prolonged or repeated use of whitening toothpaste will not only remove stains, but it will start to remove the enamel of the teeth (that is the outer, whiter part), leaving behind the inner part of the teeth which is yellower than the outer part.\u201d He advised that if a person must use a whitening toothpaste, it must be used sparingly and if a person must whiten their teeth, consulting a dentist for a professional job is necessary. Also, according to a dental health site, getthefloss.com, whitening toothpaste can sometimes make teeth stain worse. According to the site, while whitening toothpaste may remove surface stains it can be abrasive and damage the enamel (the hard outer layer of the tooth), making it even more prone to staining. The site also revealed that whitening toothpaste often doesn\u2019t contain any active whitening ingredients, or they may be missing key ingredients required to maintain healthy teeth such as fluoride.

Since its launch in March 2019 , the accelerator has helped its participating startups collectively raise over $1.7 billion in follow-on funding, the venture firm said, with over 60% of companies from the first five cohorts raising their Series A and beyond. The Surge program, which has backed over 250 startups, initially wrote checks of about $1 million each in startups but has since increased the backing amount to up to $3 million . Some noteworthy startups from earlier Surge cohorts include Doubtnut, Scaler Academy, Khatabook, Bijak, Classplus, Hevo Data, Juno, Atlan, BukuKas, Plum and Apna Club. The fresh cohort includes startups that are attempting to introduce tools to simplify workflows as well as solve bigger challenges including climate change. Sequoia said its cohort includes some startups with whom it partnered when they had no product as well as those being run by repeat founders and entrepreneurs with extensive experience in their respective sectors. These founders include the former CFO of fashion e-commerce platform Nykaa, machine learning engineers who worked on conversational AI at Meta and the first set of engineers of Uber in India. \u201cWe continue to be deeply impressed by the ambition and diversity of ideas, as well as the calibre of founders with each cohort. Surge 07 is no exception. We have partnered with all of our companies at their earliest stage of company building, with nearly half of them still in pre-launch at the start of our partnerships,\u201d said Rajan Anandan, Managing Director, Sequoia India & Southeast Asia, and Surge, in a prepared statement. \u201cOur founders bring with them a wealth of experience and creativity, and we believe that these dreamers, innovators and category creators have the potential to change the future of our region and the world,\u201d he added. A majority of the startups in the new cohort are building for global markets and targeting audiences beyond their headquarters. Nearly half of them have a presence in the U.S. and European markets, Sequoia said.

The post 9 Board Games That You Need To Play At Least Once appeared first on Kotaku Australia.",content:"The current range and quality of board games available is pretty astounding. If you walk into any game store and you\u2019ll come face-to-face with a wall of chunky games boxes, each overflowing with maps, dice, card decks and cardboard tokens. Unfortunately, being spoilt for choice is both a blessing and a curse. With so many options available, trying to figure out what title you want to play can feel a bit daunting. Especially if you\u2019re someone who is fairly new to the board game, uh, game. To help you out, we\u2019ve put together a few of our favourite titles that deserve to be part of any collection, from beginner to expert. From all-time strategy classics to epic fantasy quests and titles based on popular movies and TV shows , these are just a few board games that deserve a spot on your shelf (if you can fit them, that is). This article has been updated since its original publication. Team up with your friends to solve a mysterious haunting. Betrayal At House on the Hill has two phases \u2013 the first is the \u201cExploration\u201d phase, where the players build a mansion room by room. Eventually, you\u2019ll trigger the second phase, the \u201cHaunt\u201d, and that\u2019s where the fun starts as you\u2019re beset by supernatural monsters. To make things even more interesting, one of the players is secretly a traitor who takes the side of the monsters and uses the \u201cExploration\u201d phase to assist their undead master. With the mansion being procedurally generated, there\u2019s a ton of replay value. Unlike the rotting corpses hidden beneath the mansion\u2019s floorboards, every game feels fresh. The variation in monsters is also fun, ranging from ghosts to vampires to dragons. If you\u2019re new to the game (or these types of board games in general) it does come across as a bit overwhelming to master, but it\u2019s surprisingly easy to learn . If you\u2019re a fan of Dungeons & Dragons , there\u2019s an alternate version of Betrayal At House on the Hill that\u2019s themed around the popular tabletop RPG and set in Baldur\u2019s Gate. Where you can buy Betrayal At House on the Hill : Amazon Australia ($69) | Catch ($85) | eBay ($59.99) After years of being out of print, the Dune board game is finally available again and the world is a better place for it. Originally published in 1979 and based on Frank Herbert\u2019s classic sci-fi epic, Dune has a reputation for being one of the best board games around. The good news is that it absolutely lives up to the hype. The board game draws a healthy amount from the original novel, putting you in control of one of six factions \u2013 House Atreides, House Harkonnen, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, the Emperor and the Fremen \u2013 as you strategise, fight and scheme your way to controlling the planet Arrakis and its spice melange. Dune is great to play with friends but, much like in the novel, a huge part of the game involves diplomacy, secret alliances and inevitable betrayals. There\u2019s nothing like a fun afternoon of friendly back-stabbing. Dune has mostly aged well, although much like the deserts of Arrakis, there\u2019s a degree of random cruelness that you can\u2019t fully prepare for. Just remember that he who controls the spice controls the universe. Where you can buy Dune : Amazon Australia ($66) | Catch ($65) | eBay ($71.95) While the TV show squandered our collective goodwill over those final seasons, A Game of Thrones has remained a consistent go-to with friends. Choose your House, start manoeuvring your armies to secure as much of the Seven Kingdoms as you can, and finally claim your spot on the Iron Throne. (If you want to play as House Targaryen , you\u2019ll have to grab an expansion pack.) A Game of Thrones is an all-around solid strategy game , the real charm comes from the table politics and scheming. Making deals to crush a specific opponent, only to turn around and stab your ally in the back isn\u2019t just a fun thing to do, it\u2019s an essential tactic. For the A Song of Ice and Fire purists, the game is directly inspired by the books, with this second edition being released the same year the HBO adaptation aired. You can also try to create your own (and much better?) ending to the series. Rob Stark teams up with Stannis Baratheon, sieges Casterly Rock and decimates the Lannisters? Sure, why not? Where you can buy A Game of Thrones : Amazon Australia ($79) | Catch ($82) | eBay ($77.31 with the code PLAU15 ) Gloomhaven is only a few years old, but it\u2019s quickly become one of our favourite board games. A campaign-driven dungeon crawler where you play a mercenary trying to get paid while surviving the dangerous world surrounding Gloomhaven. It plays like a mix of eurogames and dungeon crawlers like HeroQuest , with a lot of different dungeons to explore and an emphasis on tactical decisions. There are almost 100 unique scenarios you can play through, where your every action will determine what happens next. Considering each scenario can take anywhere between one to two hours to complete, you\u2019ve got plenty of game ahead of yourself. There is so much packed into Gloomhaven that it can feel like you\u2019ve barely even scratched the surface of your campaign. Just put aside some time to set it up and clear some space on your shelf because this thing is a beast. It comes with 1,500 cards, and the whole bundle weighs around 10kg. If you\u2019re interested in Gloomhaven , but maybe aren\u2019t keen on the commitment required for both time and physical space, there is an alternative option. Jaws of the Lion is a prequel game that gives you the Gloomhaven experience but with a fraction of the quests. It\u2019s a less intensive way to learn the game and will let you slip straight into Gloomhaven proper once you\u2019re done with it. Where you can buy Gloomhaven : Amazon Australia ($175) | Catch ($185) | eBay ($179.31 with the code PLAU15 ) The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth does what it says on the box. You, and up to four other friends, play as one of J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s iconic heroes while questing your way across the realm of Middle-earth, from Gondor to the Grey Mountains. While most of the games on this list are more tactically focused, Journeys in Middle-earth places its focus squarely on adventuring . As you progress you\u2019re able to customise your skills and items, giving you just enough RPG elements that, despite playing pre-set characters, you can still give them your own spin. The game requires a companion app that takes the role of the game master while also tracking your progress and dishing out scenarios that play into the greater campaign. The app also keeps track of your character\u2019s items, which helps alleviate the usually frustrating mess of flipping through a stack of cards to find that one specific piece of equipment. Where you can buy LOTR: Journeys in Middle-earth : Amazon Australia ($149.84) | Catch ($175.85) | eBay ($149.84) Scythe is set in a dieselpunk reimagining of 1920s Europe where you play as one of five nations currently vying for control in a power vacuum created by the closure of The Factory, a capitalistic city-state that previously ruled the region. At first, Scythe does feel a bit complex but once you get the hang of it, you\u2019ll be playing one of the best engine-building games of the last decade. Farm some resources, conquer new territories, recruit new followers and activate some chunky-looking mechs to keep your domain protected. It isn\u2019t particularly combat-heavy and the skirmishes that do occur play through fairly fast. Scythe also has one of the most unique aesthetics of any board game I\u2019ve played and some gorgeous game art by Jakub Rozalski. When we first opened up our copy we spent plenty of time looking through each individual card, completely ignoring the rulebook. Where you can buy Scythe : Amazon Australia ($103.54) | Catch ($100) | eBay ($99.41 with the code PLAU15 ) I\u2019m a firm believer that every household should own a copy of this. Settlers of Catan is one of the all-time classic board games \u2014 endlessly replayable and a great place to start for those new to strategy games. The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You\u2019re plopped onto the randomly generated isle Catan and need to collect as many different types of resources as possible. From there, you\u2019ll combine those resources to build new settlements, upgrade existing ones and increase your domain by laying down some roads. It\u2019s simple to play, but the strategic trading element keeps it consistently interesting. One turn you\u2019ll be rolling in wheat, and the next you\u2019ll be trading all of your wood to get a single piece. Where you can buy The Settlers of Catan : Amazon Australia ($45) | Catch ($49) | eBay ($38.99) The set-up for Star Wars Rebellion is pretty simple: It is a period of civil war, so pick a side . The game is built around a series of skirmishes and missions that are all led by classic Star Wars heroes and villains. If you\u2019re playing as the Empire, your goal is to sniff out the Rebel Alliance\u2019s base and wipe it from existence. As the Rebels, your goal is to raise your reputation throughout the galaxy, drawing as many planets to your side as possible and strategically striking the Empire\u2019s resources. You also get a lot of great minis, ranging from Stormtroopers to X-Wings to Star Destroyers. You even get a Death Star, which, if you\u2019re a Rebel, is a looming menace. The game does take a couple of hours to play, so clear your afternoon schedule. Where you can buy Star Wars Rebellion : Amazon Australia ($133.45) | Catch ($126.95) | eBay ($132.56 with the code PLAU15 ) If you\u2019re a fan of Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization series, Tapestry is right up your alley. Starting from the dawn of mankind, it\u2019s up to you to build your own civilisation from nothing and help it grow throughout the following millennia. The type of civilisation you want to build is up to you and is influenced by which of the four skills \u2014 science, technology, exploration, and military \u2014 you want to invest your points into. The variation that comes from those is what keeps me coming back to Tapestry . We don\u2019t think we\u2019ve built the same civilisation twice, and even when we\u2019ve tried to repeat previous tactics, our strategy inevitability changes depending on what the other players are doing.

This discourse reviews the idea of health insurance and its link to universal health coverage as well as the reasons informing the mandatory health insurance scheme. It seeks to point out that our laws are getting progressive whilst implementation seems not to be at par with the intention of the legislature. S. 1 of the NHIA establishes the NHIA while S. 3 provides for its functions to include, but not limited to, promote, integrate and regulate all health insurance schemes that operate in Nigeria; ensure that health insurance is mandatory for every Nigerian and legal resident; and enforce the basic minimum package of health services for all Nigerians across all health insurance schemes operating within the country, including federal, states and FCT as well as private health insurance schemes. Others are to promote, support and collaborate with states through state health insurance schemes to ensure that Nigerians have access to quality health care that meets national health regulatory standards; and to ensure the implementation and utilisation of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund as required under the National Health Act and any guidelines as approved by the minister under that Act. S. 3 (b) of the NHIA Act, under the functions of the Authority, provides for the NHIA to ensure mandatory health insurance for every Nigerian and the country\u2019s legal residents. Health insurance is an insurance contract taken to cover the cost of medical care. The contract can be annually, monthly or over other fixed and certain periods of time. It typically caters for health care expenditures such as medical, surgical, prescription drugs, dental, and other expenses incurred by the insured. It is imperative to note that health insurance can be comprehensive or apply to a limited range of medical services. It may provide for full or partial payment of the costs of specific services. This is usually dependent on the quantum of the premium. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury treatments accessed or pay the health care provider directly. It ensures that individuals and families have access to health care services without any financial difficulty as opposed to out-of-pocket expenditure. The major difference between health insurance and out-of-pocket health expenditure is that the latter insists that patients pay upfront to access health care services whilst health insurance provides the insured (or enrolees) access to health care services which payments would be settled from the pool of contributions (premiums) paid by all the insured in the health plan. The salient elements that are basic to all the health insurance varieties include: advance remittance of premiums into the pool, gathering funds together, and being eligible to enjoy the benefits for payment of premiums made, or for being employed in situations where employment entitles a person to enjoy the benefits of health insurance. There is a distinction between health insurance and a publicly funded healthcare system, which provides coverage for every citizen or resident under a free healthcare programme. For instance, healthcare services available to indigent and poor persons by the Basic Health Care Provision Fund under S.11 of the National Health Act are not based on any premiums/insurance system but are funded through the statutory one per cent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government. The World Health Organisation defines universal health coverage as a situation where everyone has access to the health care services they require, at the time and place they require them without financial hardship. UHC connotes a scenario where all persons and communities have access to the health services they need, at the necessary time and where they are needed without financial hardship. The services being referred to include: essential health services ranging from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. To deliver these services, sufficient and capable health and care workers with optimal skills mix at the facility, outreach, and community levels are needed; they are to be evenly distributed and appropriately supported. UHC strategies enable everyone to access the services that address the most significant causes of disease and death in their society and also ensure that the quality of those services is good enough to improve the health of the people who receive them. UHC safeguards all people from public health risks and protects all people from impoverishment due to illness, whether from out-of-pocket payments for health care or loss of income when a household member falls sick. Full-scale expansion of health insurance is pivotal to the attainment of the above goals. Improved health outcomes are hinged on the possibility of attaining UHC in that as more persons are covered, their basic health needs are met. Protecting people from the financial hardship of having to make out-of-pocket expenditures for health services reduces the risk of their sliding into poverty when unexpected ill-health necessitates using up life savings, selling assets, or even borrowing, etc. Against the background of the foregoing, there are a plethora of reasons in support of compulsory and universal health insurance schemes in Nigeria. They are: to achieve universal health coverage, financial risk protection in accessing health care, introduce equity in financing health care and facilitate the implementation of the minimum core obligation of the state on the right to health. Others are to reduce the financial burden on the government, guarantee sustainability and credibility of health financing, facilitate the whole-of-society approach to health and set the building block for a vibrant and healthy population. Furthermore, health insurance is a means of poverty eradication, reduces inequality and uplifts the low strata of society. However, despite the mandatory nature of the scheme, there will still be citizens who due to their special financial and physical circumstances, may not be able to afford the premium to make them eligible to be covered by a health insurance scheme. This is where the core obligation of the state on the right to the highest attainable state of physical and mental health kicks in to ensure that special equity funds established under the law will fill the gap. This ensures that such persons access at the very minimum, the minimum package of care provided in the National Health Act. We now have a beautiful federal law on health insurance which is complemented by various state-level laws. These subnational laws also provided for compulsory and universal health insurance. Considering that insurance is item 33 on the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution, federal law will take precedence in the event of any conflict. What is now outstanding is the political will at the highest levels, expertise and capacity of the various executive and implementing agencies across the federation to ensure that the new regime of compulsory health insurance translates to improvements in universal health coverage.

The term \"faucet\" refers to the small amount of rewards, similar to the tiny drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet that could fill a cup over time. One of the first crypto faucets is the Bitcoin faucet developed in 2010 by Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. Users who completed a simple captcha could earn up to 5 BTC at a time, and 19,715 BTC in total were eventually distributed, assisting in the widespread distribution of early BTC ownership. The Bitcoin faucet was instrumental in educating the initial network of Bitcoin users, resulting in the cryptocurrency's healthy expansion later. Crypto faucets are less generous today, as the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. However, crypto faucets still play a crucial role in educating new users about cryptocurrency projects and the technology powering them and assisting novices in their crypto journey. Read on to learn everything you need to know about crypto faucets, how crypto faucets work, and how to earn free cryptocurrencies by completing simple tasks. Additionally, we've compiled a list of the best crypto faucets for earning free crypto assets in 2022 to help you avoid scammers or other malicious actors looking to infect your computer or compromise your privacy.So without further ado, let\u2019s get right to it! What Are Crypto Faucets A crypto faucet is a reward system that gives users free coins in return for performing basic tasks. To obtain free crypto, users are asked to complete simple tasks, i.e., watch videos, play games, take surveys, complete quizzes or a captcha, etc. Crypto faucets aren't a get-rich-quick scheme; they're simply fun, educational, and let you earn some free stuff in return for simple work. The simpler the work, the smaller the reward. Moreover, sometimes you must invest some time to accumulate the minimum threshold of cryptocurrencies that can be withdrawn to your wallet. Most websites have a minimum withdrawal limit on tasks, and rewards are usually sent into an internal crypto wallet when users reach the withdrawal threshold set by the platform. With the best crypto faucets, this can take as little as a day, but it can also take up to a week. Crypto faucets provide users with free cryptocurrencies to increase awareness of new cryptocurrency projects, educate users about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and encourage them to invest in them. How Do Crypto Faucets Work Crypto faucets help companies earn profits and maximize their revenue through \"traffic arbitrage,\" i.e., by sending traffic to advertising networks. Crypto facet users earn crypto rewards, i.e., a tiny portion of the revenue from the ad networks, in return for viewing ads. The same revenue-share arbitrage model works with captcha, gaming networks, survey companies, affiliate networks, etc. Crypto faucets are easy to use - you must sign up for a digital asset service or visit a cryptocurrency faucet website or app that offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for playing games, conducting surveys, watching advertisements, etc. Due to high transaction fees, networks use a micro wallet and a micropayments platform to pay off faucet rewards when the minimum withdrawal limit is reached. The earned cryptocurrency is sent to your online mini-wallet by the crypto faucet's website or app. Micro wallets are often created once you sign up for a crypto faucet. You can cash out when this micro-allocated wallet achieves a certain threshold of rewards (say, $5-10 in Bitcoin). When this happens, all the cryptocurrency is instantly moved to your actual crypto wallets. Crypto Faucet Types One way to categorize crypto faucets is by the token paid out as a reward. In the past, crypto faucets used to pay rewards in only a single cryptocurrency. The first currency-specific faucet was the Bitcoin faucet, paying rewards only in satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. Later on, in addition to Bitcoin faucets, other faucets like Litecoin faucets (Free LTC), Ethereum faucets, Monero faucets, Bitcoin Cash faucets, etc., were created. For example, Ethereum faucets pay users a certain amount of ETH for completing tasks such as solving captchas, as mandated by Ethereum-faucet.org. You can also earn ETH tokens by mining websites and solving captchas using Fire Faucet. Dutchy CORP is another free Ethereum faucet where you can complete tasks and play games to earn rewards. Currently, Altcoin Multicurrency Faucetssupport reward payouts in multiple cryptocurrencies. You can choose to withdraw your rewards in a variety of alternative coins supported by the faucet. Crypto faucets vary from airdrops, referring to crypto assets being dropped into traders\u2019 crypto wallets. An airdrop is a marketing strategy that usually requires participants to register with several platforms, be active on social media and internet forums, share posts, join discussions, etc., to earn rewards. During an airdrop, projects give away free tokens to promote their brand and gain awareness of their token. Crypto faucets also differ from bounties, a list of reward-earning tasks published by a blockchain project. Bounties are a way for a blockchain project to solicit community participation and give out one-time crypto rewards to anyone who can complete specific tasks.

The term \"faucet\" refers to the small amount of rewards, similar to the tiny drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet that could fill a cup over time. One of the first crypto faucets is the Bitcoin faucet developed in 2010 by Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. Users who completed a simple captcha could earn up to 5 BTC at a time, and 19,715 BTC in total were eventually distributed, assisting in the widespread distribution of early BTC ownership. The Bitcoin faucet was instrumental in educating the initial network of Bitcoin users, resulting in the cryptocurrency's healthy expansion later. Crypto faucets are less generous today, as the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. However, crypto faucets still play a crucial role in educating new users about cryptocurrency projects and the technology powering them and assisting novices in their crypto journey. Read on to learn everything you need to know about crypto faucets, how crypto faucets work, and how to earn free cryptocurrencies by completing simple tasks. Additionally, we've compiled a list of the best crypto faucets for earning free crypto assets in 2022 to help you avoid scammers or other malicious actors looking to infect your computer or compromise your privacy.So without further ado, let\u2019s get right to it! What Are Crypto Faucets A crypto faucet is a reward system that gives users free coins in return for performing basic tasks. To obtain free crypto, users are asked to complete simple tasks, i.e., watch videos, play games, take surveys, complete quizzes or a captcha, etc. Crypto faucets aren't a get-rich-quick scheme; they're simply fun, educational, and let you earn some free stuff in return for simple work. The simpler the work, the smaller the reward. Moreover, sometimes you must invest some time to accumulate the minimum threshold of cryptocurrencies that can be withdrawn to your wallet. Most websites have a minimum withdrawal limit on tasks, and rewards are usually sent into an internal crypto wallet when users reach the withdrawal threshold set by the platform. With the best crypto faucets, this can take as little as a day, but it can also take up to a week. Crypto faucets provide users with free cryptocurrencies to increase awareness of new cryptocurrency projects, educate users about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and encourage them to invest in them. How Do Crypto Faucets Work Crypto faucets help companies earn profits and maximize their revenue through \"traffic arbitrage,\" i.e., by sending traffic to advertising networks. Crypto facet users earn crypto rewards, i.e., a tiny portion of the revenue from the ad networks, in return for viewing ads. The same revenue-share arbitrage model works with captcha, gaming networks, survey companies, affiliate networks, etc. Crypto faucets are easy to use - you must sign up for a digital asset service or visit a cryptocurrency faucet website or app that offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for playing games, conducting surveys, watching advertisements, etc. Due to high transaction fees, networks use a micro wallet and a micropayments platform to pay off faucet rewards when the minimum withdrawal limit is reached. The earned cryptocurrency is sent to your online mini-wallet by the crypto faucet's website or app. Micro wallets are often created once you sign up for a crypto faucet. You can cash out when this micro-allocated wallet achieves a certain threshold of rewards (say, $5-10 in Bitcoin). When this happens, all the cryptocurrency is instantly moved to your actual crypto wallets. Crypto Faucet Types One way to categorize crypto faucets is by the token paid out as a reward. In the past, crypto faucets used to pay rewards in only a single cryptocurrency. The first currency-specific faucet was the Bitcoin faucet, paying rewards only in satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. Later on, in addition to Bitcoin faucets, other faucets like Litecoin faucets (Free LTC), Ethereum faucets, Monero faucets, Bitcoin Cash faucets, etc., were created. For example, Ethereum faucets pay users a certain amount of ETH for completing tasks such as solving captchas, as mandated by Ethereum-faucet.org. You can also earn ETH tokens by mining websites and solving captchas using Fire Faucet. Dutchy CORP is another free Ethereum faucet where you can complete tasks and play games to earn rewards. Currently, Altcoin Multicurrency Faucetssupport reward payouts in multiple cryptocurrencies. You can choose to withdraw your rewards in a variety of alternative coins supported by the faucet. Crypto faucets vary from airdrops, referring to crypto assets being dropped into traders\u2019 crypto wallets. An airdrop is a marketing strategy that usually requires participants to register with several platforms, be active on social media and internet forums, share posts, join discussions, etc., to earn rewards. During an airdrop, projects give away free tokens to promote their brand and gain awareness of their token. Crypto faucets also differ from bounties, a list of reward-earning tasks published by a blockchain project. Bounties are a way for a blockchain project to solicit community participation and give out one-time crypto rewards to anyone who can complete specific tasks.

In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.86 per cent at 59,135 points at 09:52 am. The stock has zoomed past 50 per cent in a month on strong earnings and healthy outlook. Meanwhile, in the past six months, the stock price of WCPM has more-than-doubled or soared 137 per cent, as against 3 per cent rise in the benchmark Sensex. For the April-June quarter (Q1FY23), the company posted over five-fold jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 208.95 crore from Rs 39.20 crore in the previous year quarter, on the back of strong operational performance. On a sequential basis, net profit of the company grew 49 per cent from Rs 140.51 crore. WCPM is involved in manufacturing of diversified range of products and has increased its presence across writing and printing segment, security and high value grade paper, creating a niche for the company in the market. Segment-wise, the packaging paper segment has witnessed a rise with growth in demand from e-commerce, food and food products, FMCG and the pharmaceutical sector. However, the demand is expected to grow 11-15 per cent year on year in the current fiscal as schools, colleges and office spaces gradually re-open. That apart, the new education policy is expected to increase student enrolment at a relatively faster pace. A gradual rise in education expenses by the Government and increased thrust on education are also likely to support demand for creamwove and maplitho (60- 65 per cent P&W segment). As the company\u2019s cable division entered into an agreement for supply of cables with large Indian Telcos, the management believes that a large network integrator for Tanfinet project and robust order book would help growth of their cable business. "With upcoming growth in the Indian and global market with 5G and FTTH, the company is well placed to take up growth path. In direction to substantially increase the footprint in export market, this year has seen good growth and we expect to double growth year-on-year for exports," the company said. WCPM\'s acquisition of Andhra Paper (APL) in October 2019 significantly improved the company\'s scale and market position, making it the fifth-largest paper manufacturer in India, with a consolidated capacity of 568,000 metric tonnes per annum (mtpa). Analysts at India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) believe that the fundamental demand prospect for paper remains stable over the medium term, given its under penetration across segments. They expect that the paper demand in the education sector would continue to grow with an increase in the literacy rate. Though copier paper could experience some slowdown over the near term, the increasing usage of computers in the sub-urban and rural areas will gradually replace the lost volumes from metro cities due to the ongoing remote working. "Overall, the writing and printing segment is likely to grow at low single digits compared to mid-single digit in the pre-covid period. However, with growing consumerism and e-commerce, and the ban on plastic usage in several states, demand for cupstock and packaging paper is likely to be healthy over the medium term," the brokerage firm said.',pubDate:"2022-08-22 05:06:40",image_url:null,source_id:"business-standard",country:["india"],category:["top"],language:"english"}],cn=function(e){var t=e.name;if(!t)throw new Error("`name`
