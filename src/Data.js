      'OUR CORRESPONDENTTEZPUR: On the occasion of World Photography Day, the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism, Tezpur University (TU) organized a photography workshop and exhibition. Renowned photographer Silpi Nalini Kanta Baruah graced the event as the chief guest. The India Inter-Nation Photography Council awarded Baruah in 1955 and in 1981 he was awarded at the International Color Slide Exhibition in Italy. Renowned astrophotographer of Assam, Dipankar Bhagawati aka Stephen Styris was invited as the resource person of the workshop, where around 50 students/ faculty and staff members of Tezpur University participated. On the occasion, the department displayed over 100 photographs in an exhibition organized at the department premises. These photographs were submitted by photography enthusiasts from across the country for a photography competition organized by the department. The theme for the competition was open while there were two categories: Student and non-student. Prof Abhijit Bora of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism delivered the welcome address while the inaugural speech was delivered by the Head of the Department, Prof Joya Chakraborty. The Registrar of Tezpur University, Dr. Biren Das and Pro Vice-Chancellor Prof Dhruba Kumar Bhattacharyya also graced the occasion with their presence. The Department felicitated Silpi Nalini Kanta Baruah for his significant contributions of over 70 years towards the art of photography. The 92-year-old photographer inaugurated the exhibition at the department and said, "The youngsters have done a great job. In our time, we didn\'t have digital cameras, for which photography was harder in comparison to the present times. But I still tried my best to click some good photographs. I am yet to capture the best photograph of my life and I won\'t die before that." "I am elated to receive this honour from the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism" Baruah added. In the workshop, Stephen Styris discussed about the science behind taking a photograph, the requisite skills for it and implementation of various learning in different genres of photography.

      "Kathmandu: In order to provide imperil premature and other in-danger infants access to maximum benefits of mother's milk at the time of needful, Bidhya Devi Bhandari, the President of Nepal on Friday inaugurated the first-ever human bank of Himalayan nations. The human milk embankment, named as 'Amrit Kosh', has been situated at the Paropakar Maternity and Women's Hospital. The bank has the provision of gathering, pasteurizing, examining, and reserving safe donors for lactating women as the prerequisite for breastfeeding in times of need. The centre of the bank has been established in collaboration between the Nepal Government and UNICEF along with European Union. According to a press release issued by UNICEF Nepal, the milk bank has the potential to ensure newborn-friendly health systems and to proffer infants and other at-risk babies access to the extensive amount of breast milk benefits whenever it is requisite. Annually, over 15 million early mature infants are born across the globe and around 81,000 premature newborns have been estimated in Nepal. Earlier in February 2021, India's Kerala state inaugurated its first-stage human milk bank by the Health Minister of Kerela K K Shailaja at the Ernakulam General Hospital. The bank has the prerequisite for ensuring breast milk for infants who are not being able to be lactated by their own mothers. The milk, which will be accumulated from lactating women, can be reserved for six months at the bank store. The milk bank has been named 'Nectar of Life' and it is worth Rs. 35 lakh. It was established by Cochin Global's Rotary Club in collaboration with the Kerala Health Department. It includes deep freezers, a pasteurisation unit, refrigerators, breast pumps etc where trained nurses have been assigned to operate the bank.Also Read: Mumbai Police Receive Threat Message of Another '26/11 Style Attack'Also Watch : ",

      "NEW DELHI: The Mumbai Police received a threat message on WhatsApp from a Pakistani number that gave a warning of a terrorist attack on the lines of the 26/11 Mumbai attack. The messages that were sent to the Mumbai traffic police's helpline number were sent from a Pakistani number. The sender warned that the attack would be executed soon in Mumbai city to revive the memories of the 26/11 terror attacks in 2008. Even though the Mumbai police have ruled out the potential threat of attack, they have now begun an investigation on the matter and are trying to trace the sender. According to police, the sender stated in the WhatsApp messages sent to the Mumbai traffic police that he is from Pakistan and an attack will be carried out in Mumbai. The person said that he is from Pakistan and that there are a few in India who are helping him to carry out the attack. He also shared some mobile numbers and warned that the attack could be carried out akin to the Sidhu Moosewala murder or the Udaipur tailor killing this year. \"We are probing the origin of the threat messages. We will soon trace the sender. We are also taking all necessary precautions in the city in view of the threat message,\" said a police officer. The messages come two days after a boat laden with AK-47 guns and ammunition was found off the Raigad coast of Maharashtra. One of India's most horrific terrorist attacks took place on November 26, 2008. Ten terrorists wreaked havoc across Mumbai killing over 150 people and injuring 300.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has now directed its Technical and Development Sub-Committee to hold a meeting and make recommendations on how to reposition the team before the World Cup billed for Australia and New Zealand.

      'CINCINNATI: World number one Daniil Medvedev wore down Denis Shapovalov 7-5, 7-5 to reach the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open on Thursday ahead of his US Open title defence.The Russian top seed was joined in the last eight by Stefanos Tsitsipas, Felix Auger-Aliassime and Borna Coric but his compatriot Andrey Rublev, the sixth seed, was ousted by Taylor Fritz. Third seed Carlos Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows last year, beat former US Open champion Marin Cilic 7-6 (4),6-1 to set up a meeting with British world number 11 Cameron Norrie, who downed American Ben Shelton 6-0, 6-2. Medvedev suffered a jarring early exit from the Canadian Masters last week but overcame some initial problems in a tricky tie against Shapovalov to edge both sets and book a meeting with American Fritz. "In general, I managed to be pretty constant," said Medvedev. "I got a lot of break opportunities. Broke first in the first set. Served pretty well even in the game where I lost my serve. In general, happy with my level and looking forward to the next matches." Fritz had to fight back from a set down to beat Rublev 6-7 (4), 6-2, 7-5 on Center Court, finding his rhythm in the second set and pounding a dozen winners past the Russian to ensure he would continue his rise up the rankings. "Obviously, I want to go even further, semis, finals, win the title but to put another Masters quarter-final on the record for the year helps a lot," said the Indian Wells champion, who stands on the brink of entering the top 10 for the first time. Croatian Coric backed up his stunning victory over Rafa Nadal late on Wednesday by taking out another Spaniard in Roberto Bautista Agut. Former World No 12 Coric is still on the comeback trail after shoulder surgery but showed he should not be underestimated at the US Open with a clinical 6-2, 6-3 victory. A quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2020, Coric will next face Canadian seventh seed Auger-Aliassime, who saved two match points in the second set in a stunning 2-6, 7-6 (1) 6-1 comeback victory over Italian Jannick Sinner. Greek fourth seed Tsitsipas took down Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3 in a little over 90 minutes after the Argentine served up nine double faults and will next face American John Isner, a 7-6 (3), 1-6, 7-6(4) winner over compatriot Sebastian Korda.Swiatek, Raducanu, Kontaveit ousted World number one Iga Swiatek and reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu were both knocked out of the Cincinnati Open on Thursday, while second seed Anett Kontaveit also had her preparations for Flushing Meadows cut short in the round of 16. Raducanu had beaten former Grand Slam champions Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka in the previous two rounds but was brought down to earth with a bump in a 7-5, 6-4 loss to American seventh seed Jessica Pegula. Another American, Madison Keys, earlier accounted for Swiatek to take her place in the quarter-finals and register her first win over a reigning world number one. Swiatek saved four match points but was far from her best as she exited a second tournament in the North American swing at the last-16 stage after last week\'s Canadian Open. Keys had failed to take a set off the Pole in two previous meetings but was far more clinical with her powerful returns and groundstrokes, breaking the world number one five times in the 6-3, 6-4 victory. Keys will next face Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who beat Alison Riske-Amritraj 6-2, 6-4 to sail into the quarter-finals. Wimbledon finalist and fifth seed Ons Jabeur also made her exit, ushered out of the door by twice major winner Petra Kvitova 6-1, 4-6, 6-0. Kvitova next faces Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, who staged a stunning comeback to beat Russian Veronika Kudermetova 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-3 and reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final. World number two Kontaveit looked to have taken charge of her tie against Zhang Shuai when she won the opening set at a canter but her Chinese opponent dug deep to claim a stunning 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 upset. Eighth seed Aryna Sabalenka later takes on Shelby Rogers for a place in the last eight.

      "Do you like the smell of rain? (Picture: Getty) Rejoice! For rain has blessed us once again. After that gruelling heatwave (RIP to all grass everywhere), we finally have miserable British weather back again. While most of us never thought we’d want rain to beckon, it has been nice to have some coolness and watch our gardens and green spaces get some much-needed moisture. And if you were out and about while it poured down, or indeed near a garden, you would’ve smelled that fresh earthy fragrance. Chances are, you took a right big whiff of the stuff, and it was more fragrant than ever. The scent you’re smelling (and likely enjoying) isn’t just because you haven’t seen the heavens open up in a while, it’s actually a scientific response to rainfall after a drought and the like. Scientists at MIT have figured out that rain releases an aromatic aerosol which creates that familiar smell, particulalry after a long period without. And we love this fragrance (there’s even perfumes and candles that try to imitate it) as humans are extremely sensitive to the geosmin that makes up this particular smell, and we can detect in very small quantities, as low as five parts per trillion. Give it a sniff (Picture: Getty Images/EyeEm) Using high-speed cameras, the researchers observed that when a raindrop hits a porous surface, it traps tiny air bubbles at the point of contact. As in a glass of champagne, the bubbles then shoot upward, ultimately bursting from the drop in a fizz of aerosols. The researchers suspect that in natural environments, aerosols may carry aromatic elements, along with bacteria and viruses stored in soil. These aerosols may be released during light or moderate rainfall, and then spread via gusts of wind. In heavy rainfall though, they may be less evident as they’re washed away. ‘Rain happens every day — it’s raining now, somewhere in the world,’ said Cullen R. Buie, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. ‘It’s a very common phenomenon, and it was intriguing to us that no one had observed this mechanism before.’ The scientists can also use this evidence to look into soil-based disease.

      "Mumbai: Actress Mahima Chaudhry has been roped in to play the role of cultural activist and author Pupul Jayakar. She revealed that Pupul Jayakar was Indira Gandhi’s childhood friend so her scenes are the ones where you get to see the non-political side of the great leader. In the film, Kangana Ranaut will be seen playing former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and actor Anupam Kher, the revolutionary leader J.P. Narayan. Shreyas Talapade will essay the role of late politician Atal Bihari Vajpayee who has served three terms as the country’s Prime Minister. Mahima, who plays Pupul Jayakar, said: “Working with Kangana is an experience because she wears so many hats with such great ease. She is playing such an important political character, Mrs Indira Gandhi.” She added: “She is directing it herself and producing it. I get a lot of strength looking at her and the way she functions. Pupul Jayakar was Mrs Gandhi’s childhood friend so my scenes are the ones where you get to see the non-political side of this great and controversial political leader during the time of Emergency.” “They are very open and honest with each other. You see a very different side of Mrs Gandhi. It’s very interesting to play this character and it’s been a wonderful experience working on this.” Talking about this character, Kangana says: “Pupul Jayakar was an author, a very close friend of Mrs. Gandhi and has also written her autobiography. Mrs. Gandhi confided in her about everything. If there is one thread that runs through the film and connects the audiences to the inner world of Mrs. Gandhi, then it’s the character of Pupul Jayakar.”   View this post on Instagram   A post shared by Mahimachaudhry (@mahimachaudhry1) “Even though the film is a first-person account, it is not a film where somebody is the narrator. Mrs. Gandhi’s interactions with Pupul are the most soulful. She added: “They shed light on how she confided her deepest darkest secrets to Pupul Jayakar. This makes her character an important person in the film called Emergency.” Manikarnika films presents Emergency, which is written and directed by Kangana Ranaut. The film is produced by Renu Pitti and Kangana Ranaut. The screenplay and dialogues are by Ritesh Shah.",

      "The $1 trillion industry super fund movement is called on the federal government to develop a national strategy to reduce Australia’s carbon emissions.",
    content:
      "In a paper to be released on Tuesday, the sector’s peak body – Industry Super Australia – wrote that funds were looking to make more investment in projects which will lower carbon usage but need more comprehensive policies around sectors such as renewable energy.“The opportunities for further investment to decarbonise Australia’s economy are immense and are set to grow with most industry funds looking to invest in this sector over the next five years,” the paper reads.“However, without a clear national strategy and government policy to invest in the energy transition, opportunities to invest in Australia will continue to be constrained.”“Greater policy stability around renewables, carbon reduction targets, innovation and other policies would help funds to further invest in decarbonising Australia’s economy.”The organisation’s chief executive, Bernie Dean, said the sector wanted the government to remove barriers to institutional investment in projects that helped decarbonise the economy.The Albanese government has promised that it will reduce carbon emissions by 43 per cent by 2030, a more aggressive step on the road to net zero by 2050 than the Morrison government.But industry and investors, including the cashed-up super sector, are looking for more detailed government policies on how it plans to deliver on its promises.The ISA report notes that the OECD delivered a “scathing assessment” of Australia’s climate change policies late last year, “warning that the pace of decarbonisation efforts would have to massively accelerate if our country is to meet even its baseline targets”.It also notes that the Clean Energy Council has warned that continued uncertainty was hampering decarbonisation efforts, particularly around large-scale renewable energy projects.The report argues that industry super funds are ideally placed to invest in long-term unlisted local assets including those which would be part of a decarbonisation policy.The funds have some $100bn in unlisted assets in Australia.Hostplus has partnered with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Octopus Australia to develop a renewable energy generation project in Victoria to help replace the Yallourn coal fired power station which is scheduled for closure in 2028.Other examples include investments in wind farms at Warradarge and Albany and solar farms at Greenough River in Western Australia by Cbus. Industry super fund vehicle IFM Investors also having significant funds in renewable assets through its infrastructure debt team.The report also calls on the government to consider ways that funds can participate in nation building projects, particularly through private equity and unlisted assets.It calls on the government to nominate “strategic industries of the future” and create more efficient, sector-based incentives to encourage the flow of capital to them.The paper – which comes at a time when some critics have questioned whether the extensive unlisted assets held by industry super funds are accurately valued – argues that the sector’s investments in those assets give its funds an investment return edge.“Industry super funds’ $100bn in unlisted assets not only provides excellent investment returns to members, but they also create jobs, increase productivity and fuel economic growth,” the report reads. “Industry funds have greater exposure to unlisted assets such as property, infrastructure and equities than retail funds.”It says the higher exposure to unlisted assets means that a 40 year old member would have been more than $11,000 better off over the past 10 years, giving them an extra $137,000 at their retirement. The report says industry super funds currently hold investments in projects which are helping to abate 3.6 million tonnes of carbon annually with developments in place which will take this to 14.2 million a year by 2030.$100 INVESTED 10 YEARS AGO IS NOW WORTH …The report, which seeks to detail the broad range of investment by industry funds in areas from agriculture to manufacturing and start-ups to debt financing, is part of a campaign by the sector to show its support as a long term supplier of capital for local industry.But the sector is also pushing the government for more policy stability, including legislation protecting it from any new policies for early access to superannuation, such as the Morrison governments’ early access scheme in 2020 and the proposal to make superannuation available for first home buyers put forward by the Morrison government before the election.“Protecting, rather than trashing the fundamentals of the super system is the key to leveraging the power of our investment capacity to do good and strengthen our economy,” Mr Dean said.",

      "An Indian upstart, co-founded by a group of journalists, that seeks to disrupt how people follow news and what they consume has raised capital as it prepares to accelerate its growth and broaden its offering. The Signal is aiming to serve a need for the modern pace of life where everybody is busy, said Dinesh Narayanan, its co-founder and editor in an interview. “People still want to keep up with what’s happening in the world. They can read newspapers or multiple news outlets, but obviously they don’t have time to do it,” he said. The Noida-headquartered startup has been attempting to solve this with an eponymous newsletter and podcast where it curates, produces and discusses what they argue are the most important developments from the world of business, technology, economy and policy. The newsletter, which goes out six times a week, features nearly a dozen stories in each edition and deep dives into two to three major stories, offering additional context and commentary from a team of journalists who have previously worked at newsrooms including The Economic Times, The Quint, YourStory, The Morning Context and Reuters. Today, @dire_nair and the folks @TheSignalDotCo featured @thecaptableco's story on Nykaa Superstore + made more great points about the challenges of going B2B. Check out their whole piece (and subscribe!) here: https://t.co/9J2yxa2hFu pic.twitter.com/HvmvydLZsU — Soumya (@bytesofnews) August 22, 2022 Signal says it is aiming to serve savvy audiences in India and beyond. It has amassed over 38,000 subscribers, a base that includes several unicorn founders, lawmakers and policy executives. Its newsletter goes out at 8 AM and requires just five to seven minutes of reader time, said Narayanan. The startup, which plans to expand its coverage into more areas including sports and launch newer products, isn’t currently charging its readers and listeners. Instead, most newsletters are currently backed by big name sponsors. Narayanan argued that a sponsor-backed model is the more sustainable way to monetize a news product in the country. “Everybody talks about this total addressable market, right? Nobody really knows what exactly it is today because you have a population of probably about 150-200 million people who can afford to pay. There are so many avenues available to people which is giving them free news. It is a very small sliver of the audience which would actually pay,” he said. “So some of them would be paying because it’s good journalism, some of them would be paying because they give exactly the amount of news which they want, some of them would be paying for the depth of content. I think the existing players are already competing for this rather small pie.” Each Saturday, Signal publishes original stories in a newsletter called The Intersection. The Signal, whose most other founding members including Venkat Ananth and Patanjali Pahwa are also journalists, is the latest independent media venture in the South Asian nation, which is the one of the world’s largest news markets. The founding team also includes ex-Google India public policy official Rajneil Kamath and Chinmay Bhogle, formerly of Times Internet, Star Sports and Tata Motors. Several journalists in the country have left their influential jobs at top media houses in recent years to build something of their own as they grow frustrated at attempting to bring systemic changes to the way legacy outlets work – or take inspiration from a similar flow in the U.S., where journalists have traditionally shown more entrepreneurial instincts. But unlike the U.S. and the UK, where several media venture founders have made successful exits, India is yet to demonstrate any. At the end of the day, the future of the Signal depends on the purchasing power per capita of the nation, Narayanan said. As the “purchasing power increases and the consumption patterns change, purely on that basis … exits and the size of exits are a function of that. It’s a business. Yeah, so it is definitely tied to the fortunes of the country as a whole,” he added. For now, that’s not something The Signal needs to worry about. The startup said Monday it has raised a new funding round, but did not disclose the size. The Signal’s angel investors include CRED’s Miten Sampat, Zomato co-founder Deepinder Goyal, Unacademy co-founder Gaurav Munjal, Haptik co-founder Aakrit Vaish, media entrepreneur Parry Ravindranathan, Vue.ai founder Ashwini Asokan and DealStreetAsia founder and CEO Joji Philip Thomas. Investment fund LetsVenture led the round, while venture capital fund Capital A also participated in it, Narayanan said. Fintech-focused fund Rainmatter also invested in the round, according to a regulatory filing. (Narayanan and Rainmatter didn’t comment on the fund’s participation.) “Venkat, Patanjali, Dinesh & Roshni P Nair have authored some of the most important stories in India tech over the past 5 years, and I am very excited to see them build The Signal as a way to enable readers make sense of it all,” said Sampat. “India, and eventually the world, needs an outlet that goes beyond newsflashes and gets deep into nuanced reportage through a mix of curation, original writing and new formats of sense-making.”",

      "This post is brought to you by Maxis. While the advent of digitalisation shifted consumer behaviour tremendously over the years, the pandemic event the world faced together helped to further accelerate this shift. Hybrid working became the new norm with more people opting to work from home and some education institutions creating virtual classrooms. Due to shifting consumer behaviours, the frequently performed activities have become streaming and web browsing. In fact, video streaming makes the bulk of Maxis’ total network traffic, followed by browsing, social networking, instant messaging, VoIP, gaming, and shopping as more people are consuming entertainment from home. Not to mention that today’s IoT devices are becoming smarter and more sophisticated, allowing a single product to perform multiple tasks. Meanwhile, digital services like video and game streaming are consuming more data as 4K resolution is becoming the default standard. However, it’s the activity of using multiple apps at a time that’s increasing the demand for higher bandwidth and seamless connectivity. “In the past two and half years, digital adoption by Malaysians in many ways, from the way we shop to how businesses equip themselves with digital capabilities and channels to reach more customers. We have also seen how quickly many sectors have moved into a hybrid mode of working and learning from home and on-site. We believe a lot of these new practices will remain as the new norm post-pandemic,” says Loh Keh Jiat, Maxis’ Chief Marketing Officer. There is a huge dependency to be connected in every way possible, whether at home or on the go. For Maxis, the convergence of mobile and home services is key, and its fibre propositions are playing a significant role in meeting the ever-growing demands for a great connectivity experience at home. Maxis’ fibre offerings go as far back as 10 years ago. Following the implementation of the Mandatory Standard on Access Pricing back in 2018, the industry had the opportunity to offer more choices at competitive prices to consumers and businesses. In a first mover advantage, Maxis led the market in new affordable home and business fibre broadband plans through its Fibrenation campaign, with packages up to 65% cheaper than what they had previously offered. “These new plans had essentially opened a new era of accessible and affordable fibre broadband for even more Malaysian homes and businesses. Today, the demands for Internet consumption have grown tremendously, and our focus has been on providing higher speeds and with greater affordability. Therefore, we started offering 300Mbps up to 800Mbps, even before the pandemic and today we are proud to have the widest fibre footprint which is a result of our own fibre infrastructure and wholesale partnerships,” says Loh. According to Maxis, the fixed broadband segment remained relatively untapped with 65% of homes fiberised and less than 55% of those fiberised homes connected, at the end of 2021. In addition to its own fibre build, Maxis is serving more than 5 million premises. “We believe there is a great future for fixed broadband in Malaysia, with significant growth potential in this untapped market. Fibre is the best for connectivity for the home. For customers in locations that do not have fibre coverage, they can still enjoy connectivity via wireless broadband. For example, with Maxis Home 4G Wi-Fi, customers will be on our 4G network where they will be able to enjoy unlimited data for all services from work, learning and play. “They can also get unlimited data for all lines for the whole family by combining any of their mobile lines with the plan. With a Plug & Play, easy setup, customers will be able to connect instantly, with no installation required, and use multiple devices at once. All with the option to add on home devices with zero upfront on our easy device ownership programme, Zerolution,” adds Loh. Currently, Maxis has a couple of projects under its belt like assisting with the Government’s JENDELA plan, addressing how 4G can help to accelerate broadband availability to homes where fibre infrastructure is not yet available and continuing to evaluate the possibility of more partnerships with infrastructure manufacturers and vendors. “More and more of our customers are enjoying fibre connectivity and this is evident in the consistent growth of our fibre connections quarter on quarter. As of Q2 2022, we have 638,000 fibre and 4G wireless home broadband connections nationwide due to the strong adoption of our converged packages and wider deployment to underserved areas. Meanwhile, we continue to expand our broadband footprint to secondary towns, via both fibre and 4G to bring connectivity to even more Malaysians,” said Loh. Maxis attributes its consistent growth in home connections to the success of Maxis Unlimited Postpaid and Fibre, where customers who are on Maxis Fibre have unlimited data on their postpaid lines, with a tremendous sign-up rate since its launch. “We continue to see very strong YoY growth in data usage and recorded all-time high utilisation of our converged network of mobile and fibre connectivity. What’s interesting is that our fibre network now carries almost 2x more traffic than the mobile network. We believe this is closely linked to the shift in customer behaviour as mentioned and the expectation of service providers to offer more than just either mobile or fixed. And Maxis is here to provide that with the demand for converged connectivity continuing to rise,” says Loh. Meanwhile, Arjun Varma, Head of Maxis Consumer, says that product innovation has been central to Maxis’ efforts in offering an unmatched personalised experience for its customers. “Surpassing the half-million subscriber mark was a significant milestone for us in our fibre journey, and we owe this to our sharp focus on innovation around services and home experience propositions, as well as a deep understanding of changing customer behaviour and needs. This had essentially translated into a simplified journey for our customers. For example, we make it very easy for customers to own their favourite home devices with initiatives such as our successful Zerolution programme,” says Arjun. By listening to its customers, Maxis has designed relevant solutions, underpinned by its high-performing network. The outcome is plans catered to specific segments, such as the Maxis Family Plan which addresses the everyday needs of a family such as data, home internet, or accessibility to new devices. “These propositions have helped us create extreme relevance in the market. Our propositions are also built with our Rangkaian Kita Rangkaian Malaysia premise in mind, meaning that it caters to Malaysians from all walks of life-based on their diverse and unique requirements. As the digital world continues to evolve, we continue to listen to our customers and review trends in the market against our propositions to ensure we constantly innovate to bring as much value as possible,” says Arjun. “Another differentiating factor is our fibre service through our dedicated Internet experts, Maxperts, who not only install routers but ensure that the Wi-Fi is optimised for the best connectivity experience for the home. We have dedicated staff, physically, over the phone and online, serving with our expertise, complemented with AI-powered chatbots to serve customers 24-7,” added Arjun. Loh says that Maxis has big ambitions in expanding its fibre footprint to bring affordable and high-speed connectivity to every home and business premise in Malaysia through building its own fibre network as well as developing partnerships with other access providers in the market. “For our own fibre build, we will have approximately 400k premise passes to be rolled out over the next 12-18 months as part of JENDELA, including in Tier 2 and 3 areas, which will bring high-speed broadband access to families living in non-urban areas in Selangor, Kuala Lumpur, Perlis, Kedah, Penang, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Johor, as well as the East Coast regions, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang. “We also build fibre networks for enterprises and offer a wide range of business fibre connectivity solutions for a truly converged experience. With an expanded fibre footprint, we will be able to further support more people, businesses, and the government in a rapidly evolving digital economy, as well as the nation’s digitalisation agenda,” says Loh. “There is a promising future for fibre, as both residential customers and businesses rely heavily on communications, video conferencing and video streaming. For Maxis, we are already playing a key role as a catalyst for digitalisation for individuals, businesses and the nation through our connectivity and digital solutions. “With our ‘all-ways’ connected proposition, we are committed to bringing together the best of technologies to enable people, businesses, and the nation to always be ahead in a changing world,” concluded Loh.

      'A Correspondent ITANAGAR, Aug 20: Current coach of the national badminton team, Pullela Gopichand on Saturday declared open the Li-Ning 9th Dorjee Khandu Memorial State Badminton Championship at Arunachal Badminton Academy here in presence of Chief Minister Pema Khandu and Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Mama Natung. Khandu, on behalf of the state government and the people, welcomed Gopichand and expressed gratitude for inaugurating the tournament. "Your mere presence in the beginning of the tournament is a huge encouragement and inspiration for our young shuttlers as for them you are the real star," Khandu said during the simple opening ceremony. He advised the participants not to worry about the results but give their best to each and every game they play. "Winning or losing is not as important as participation and giving it your best shot. Keep up the spirit of sportsmanship – win with humility and lose with dignity," he said. Talking about the overall sporting scenario of the country, Khandu credited the supportive and proactive role of the central government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have catapulted India as a major sporting nation in the international arena. He cited the medal winning performances of Indian athletes in the last Olympic Games and the recently held Commonwealth Games. "Last 7-8 years have witnessed a paradigm shift in the performance of our sportspersons of all fields. Arunachal Pradesh, as a small state, too has seen its sportspersons shining at various levels," he observed. While recalling the role of his late father and former Chief Minister Dorjee Khandu, in whose memory the annual tournament is held, Khandu said the state government is committed to provide all facilities to budding sportspersons both in infrastructure and opportunities. He informed that since 2016, players from the state have bagged 314 Gold, 212 Silver and 277 Bronze medals in various recognized international, national and zonal games. "We are building world class infra like indoor and outdoor stadiums. One sports academy is being made functional in eastern Arunachal. We have approved construction of stadium in Tirap district. The work on stadiums at Aalo, Tezu and Chimpu is being reviewed regularly for early completion," he revealed. Appreciating ASBA for its relentless efforts to provide facilities to young shuttlers of the state, Khandu insisted that the 6 court badminton facility being developed here be completed as early as possible. "I request the department concerned to complete the 6-court facility at the earliest and hand it over to ASBA to facilitate conduction of events and trainings," he said. The weeklong tournament will consist of 26 events with nearly 300 players including 69 women players.

      "Pakistani media suggested that an arrest warrant has been issued against former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan.",
    content:
      "On August 21, former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan was booked under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act over his comments at a rally in Islamabad a day earlier. Soon after, there were reports that an arrest warrant against Khan was issued, leading to a law and order situation. His supporters not only showed solidarity on the streets but also on social media platforms. A large number of supporters reached his Bani Gala residence amid the reports of the arrest warrant. Live broadcast of Khan’s speeches banned by PEMRA The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) issued an order banning the live telecast of Khan’s speeches on all satellite TV channels. Furthermore, his official YouTube channel has been blocked by the authorities, which added more fuel to the fire. In a tweet Khan said, “The fascist Imported govt sunk to a new low today by banning live coverage of my speeches on TV & then blocking YouTube temporarily during my speech at Liaquat Bagh. All this after continuous intimidation of media persons & taking channels off air earlier.” This is not only a gross violation of freedom of speech but also negatively affects the digital media industry and the livelihoods of many. What they need to understand is that no matter what they do, they cannot suppress the will of the people which is Haqeeqi Azadi.— Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) August 21, 2022 He added, “This is not only a gross violation of freedom of speech but also negatively affects the digital media industry and the livelihoods of many. What they need to understand is that no matter what they do, they cannot suppress the will of the people which is Haqeeqi Azadi.” As per The Dawn’s report, PEMRA issued a four-page document instructing them not to telecast Khan’s live speech on Saturday, where he had targeted police and Judicial officials. The recorded speech was allowed with conditions including a time-delay mechanism. PTI leaders slammed the government on social media Amidst the political drama prevailing in the neighbouring country, PTI leaders slammed the current leadership and urged supporters to take the streets “for the sake of Pakistan.” PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said in a tweet that Khan was at home, and hundreds of workers had reached his residence to show support. Murad Saeed, a close aide of Khan, informed his followers about the ‘arrest warrant’ against Khan and urged his supporters to “get out for the sake of Pakistan.” Several other leaders, including Hammad Azhar, Farrukh Habib, and others, urged the PTI supporters to take on the streets in their respective cities and asked them to reach specific locations in large numbers. PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur took a step further and issued a warning to the Police to stay away from the “political war. If Imran Khan is arrested by the imported government, we will take over Islamabad,” he warned. “And my message to police is that don’t be part of this political war anymore; otherwise, will deal [with] you as PDM workers, not police anymore let PTI and PDM leadership and workers fight and decide once and for all.” If imran khan is arrested by the imported govt we will take over Islamabad and my message to police is that don’t be part of this political war anymore otherwise will deal u as pdm workers not police anymore let pti and pdm leadership and workers fight and decide once and for all— Ali Amin Khan Gandapur (@AliAminKhanPTI) August 21, 2022 Police refuted claims about the arrest but issued a warning Islamabad police media director Taqi Jawad was quoted by The Dawn saying that though Police teams had reached the Bani Gala residence of the former PM, it was not for the arrest but to maintain law and order. He said following the reports of an arrest warrant being issued got circulated, a large number of PTI supporters reached Bani Gala leading to the possibility of a law and order situation in the area. The Police went only to maintain law and order. He further added if Police plan to arrest Khan, a media release will be issued for the same. In a series of tweets, the Islamabad Capital Territory Police (ICT) issued warnings to PTI leaders, including former PM Khan, against the threats. It said, “Anyone threatening the police or making false accusations will be dealt with according to the law.” The Police added that it has been doing its duty and will continue to do so with due diligence. Reminding the leaders that the Police personnel took an oath to serve the nations, it added that the department would continue to do so. ICT added, “All officers are rendering their services with complete responsibility and continue to discharge them. The Police is an organized institution, and we are bound to perform our duties come what may.” It further warned strict action against those who level false allegations against the department. Imran Khan’s security withdrawn, alleged PTI leader PTI leader Shireen Mazari alleged that ICT had withdrawn Imran Khan’s security following his Saturday night speech. She said, “This is against the law, but who cares about the law in this Imported government? The nation should know how conspirators are creating a life threat for Imran Khan.” FIR against Imran Khan The FIR against PTI chief over his Saturday night speech was registered at around 10 PM at Islamabad’s Margalla police station over a complaint filed by magistrate Ali Javed. As per the FIR, Khan “terrorized and threatened top police officials and a respected female additional sessions judge.” In his Saturday address, Khan had threatened to file cases against the IG and DIG of the Islamabad Police and threatened he would not “spare them.” He further threatened Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry and said she should “prepare herself as the action would be taken against her.” In his complaint, the magistrate argued that the address created hurdles in the proper functioning of the Police department and judiciary and asked for strict action against Khan. Allegations of mental, physical, and sexual torture of PTI leader Shehbaz Gill in custody During his address, PTI leader Imran Khan demanded justice for his Chief of Staff Shahbaz Gill and alleged he was mentally, physically, and sexually tortured during 2-day Police custody. He said, “All the pictures and videos clearly show that Gill was tortured both mentally and physically, including sexual abuse – most too gruesome to tell.” Gill was arrested by ICT in the case against him for inciting “mutiny among armed forces.”",

      "New Delhi, Aug 21 (PTI) The government has no plans to import wheat as it has sufficient stocks to meet the country's requirements, the Department of Food and Public Distribution said on Sunday.",
    content:
      "The government has no plans to import wheat as it has sufficient stocks to meet the country's requirements, the Department of Food and Public Distribution said on Sunday.The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has enough stock for public distribution, it said.\"There is no such plan to import wheat into India. Country has sufficient stocks to meet our domestic requirements and @FCI_India has enough stock for public distribution,\" the Department of Food and Public Distribution said in a tweet.The comments come against the backdrop of some reports which said India may import the food grain.India's wheat production is projected to have declined nearly 3% to 106.84 million tonnes while the overall food grain production is estimated to have touched record 315.72 million tonnes in the 2021-22 crop year.Wheat production is estimated to have declined due to a heatwave that resulted in shrivelled grains in the northern states of Punjab and Haryana.According to the fourth advance estimate for the 2021-22 crop year released by the agriculture ministry recently, record output is estimated for rice, maize, gram, pulses, rapeseed and mustard, oilseeds and sugarcane.A wheat flour millers' body earlier this month demanded that the government scrap the 40% import duty on wheat to boost domestic supplies and control prices.Members of the Roller Flour Millers' Federation of India met Food Secretary Sudhanshu Pandey on Wednesday to discuss the issue of price rise and shortage of wheat in the market, it said in a statement.The federation's President Anjani Agarwal has said the price of wheat has increased by Rs 300-350 per quintal in the last 15 days.The industry body has raised concerns regarding unavailability of wheat and the drastic rise in price in the last few days even though the harvest season ended just a month back and the new crop would arrive only after eight months from now.It has also demanded the release of wheat under the Open Market Sales Scheme through a tender process for user industries.In May, India had banned wheat exports in a bid to check high prices amid concerns of wheat output being hit by a scorching heat wave.In July, the government had stated that wheat stocks in FCI godowns are expected to be 134 lakh tonnes at the start of next fiscal, 80% more than the buffer norm.In a written reply in the Rajya Sabha, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Piyush Goyal had said the central pool stock of wheat as on July 1, 2022 is well above the food grains stocking norms.India had exported a record 7 million tonnes of wheat during 2021-22 fiscal. The wholesale price-based inflation eased to a five-month low of 13.93% in July on easing prices of food articles and manufactured products. Inflation in food articles in July eased to 10.77% from 14.39 per cent in June. . Read more on Nation by BloombergQuint.",

      "*Tells electricity board to protect interests of ordinary citizens *BPE says four Discos successfully taken over Deji Elumoye in Abuja The Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has assured Nigerians that the inauguration of a board for the Nigeria Electricity Liability Management Company (NELMCO) would enhance ongoing efforts to resolve liabilities relating to tariff shortfalls for distribution companies, among other challenges plaguing the nation’s power sector. The company has been running without a duly constituted board since the first one was inaugurated in 2013 and dissolved shortly after. Speaking at the weekend, at the virtual inauguration of a new 10-man board for NELMCO in Abuja, Osinbajo stressed that the inauguration marked an important milestone in the bid to resolve the liabilities relating to tariff shortfalls in the power sector (specifically for Distribution Companies), and to provide a veritable mechanism for managing the very dynamic nature of the liquidity challenges of the power sector in Nigeria. According to him, “this ceremony formally brings on board the invaluable skills and experience of notable and highly respected personalities as members of the Board of NELMCO.” On what was expected from the new board, the vice president told members that, “as a board, you are expected to make conscious and deliberate efforts to develop appropriate strategies to facilitate the successful conclusion of the outstanding pre-privatisation issues of the defunct PHCN, and ensure an effective implementation of NELMCO’s additional mandate to resolve the tariff shortfall problems of the Electricity Distribution Companies. “In view of the challenges ahead, you are expected to draw extensively on our experience over the years, to continue to give credence to the Federal Government of Nigeria’s economic development programme in a transparent, sustainable, credible and acceptable manner. “The Board is required to take appropriate steps to also ensure that the interests of the various segments of our society, particularly the ordinary citizens, are protected in the implementation of NELMCO’s mandate.” Commenting on the board’s mandate, Osinbajo charged members to diligently carry out the responsibilities assigned to the board in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum and Articles of Association (MEMART) of the Company. Some of the provisions of the MEMART of the company include: To assume and administer the stranded debts of the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) Plc pursuant to the provisions of Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005. To manage post-privatisation liabilities in the power sector as may be directed by the National Council on Privatisation or any authorised agency of the federal government from time to time in line with the power sector reform act 2005. Responding on behalf of the members, the Board Chairperson and Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, assured the vice president of the board’s preparedness to ensure quick resolution of tariff shortfalls and related issues in the power sector in the most efficient manner. Other members of the board include the Minister of Power, Abubakar Aliyu; Director General of Bureau for Public Enterprises (BPE), Mr. Alex Okoh; Director General of Debt Management Office (DMO), Ms. Patience Oniha; Managing Director of NELMCO, Mr. Bayo Fagbemi and Mr. Muhammad Aliyu Jumma’a. It also included Mr. Olufunso Olutola Olukoga; Dr. Chinedum Orisakwe; Mojoyinoluwa Dekalu-Thomas and Dr Nurain Hassan Ibrahim. In a related development, the BPE Director General, Mr. Alex Okoh, has said the take-over of four electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) namely that of Kaduna, Kano, Ibadan and Port Harcourt has been concluded successfully. Okoh, who disclosed this in a presentation made at a virtual meeting of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP), added that the challenge in the takeover of the Benin Disco was being addressed. The NCP is chaired by the vice president who was represented at the meeting by Ahmed, who also doubles as the Vice Chairperson of the Council. In his report to the Council, the BPE DG also made a presentation on the concession of the Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant, inviting NCP to note steps taken by the Bureau to fast track the process. Okoh thereafter presented for approval a proposal to amend the Procedures Manual of the BPE, especially in the areas of legal framework; reform activities; pre-transaction activities; project advisory and delivery team; receipt of technical and financial transaction strategies, and opening and evaluation of technical proposals, among others.",

      "Game of Thrones drew to an end after eight long-running seasons, but author George R.R. Martin wanted the series to last at least 10 seasons on HBO. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, the man shared that he wanted more runtime to delve deeper into storytelling. “I was saying it needs to be 10 seasons at least and maybe 12, 13. I lost that one,” he said. “I had no contribution to the later seasons except, you know, inventing the world, the story, and all the story. I believe I have more influence now [on House of the Dragons] than I did on the original show.” The lack of involvement is not surprising, considering how the events of Game of Thrones went past the storyline established by the books Martin has published thus far. House of the Dragons, as the sequel to Game of Thrones, is based on the the latter’s book Fire and Blood, so his insights would be useful and invaluable to the team. The 10-episode show is set 200 years before Game of Thrones, and tells the tale of how the Targaryens rose to power and claim the Iron Throne. It stars Paddy Considine as King Viserys Targaryen, Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen, Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower, Emma D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, Steve Toussaint as Lord Corlys Velaryon, ‘The Sea Snake’, Eve Best as Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, Fabien Frankel as Ser Criston Cole, Sonoya Mizuno as Mysaria, and Rhys Ifans as Otto Hightower. House of the Dragons premieres today, 22 August, on HBO Max and HBO Go. Meanwhile, a spin-off series focusing on Jon Snow (Kit Harrington) is set to arrive sometime in the near future.

      "PARIS, Aug 22 — This year was supposed to confirm the world economy’s comeback from the Covid pandemic crisis. Instead, the six-month-old war in Ukraine has sparked fears of recession. Two ‘small’ economies rattle world “Six short months ago the macro landscape was markedly different from today,” the financial data firm S&P Global said in a recent report. Both the United States and eurozone economies were expected to see strong growth, and elevated inflation levels were seen by policymakers and markets as transitory. “Things have changed, and not for the better,” added S&P Global. Global growth forecasts have been repeatedly cut, with the International Monetary Fund now expecting a 3.2 per cent expansion compared to nearly five per cent earlier. Russia and Ukraine together account for just two per cent of global output and trade, according to the OECD. But Russia is a major exporter of oil, gas and agricultural goods, while many developing countries rely heavily on grain from Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world. The war has disrupted those shipments, causing energy and food prices to surge worldwide. Inflation has soared everywhere, prompting central banks to aggressively hike rates — a move that usually tames prices but slows economic activity. Prices soar everywhere In Tunis, “low-income people are living a nightmare”, said Naima Degaoui, a 70-year-old former nurse. “Prices on almost everything are rising: peaches, apricots, peppers for which the prices have quadrupled, red meat,” she added. Some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) away in the Chilean city of Valparaiso, 33-year-old social worker Nayib Pineira said “everything is much more expensive”. He said local gasoline prices have risen to 1,300 pesos per litre (1.42 euros per litre, US$5.50 per US gallon) — “nearly what Europeans pay, but with a European salary”. In Europe, natural gas prices have soared as Russia has slashed deliveries to countries that oppose the war. Oil prices have jumped, too. The rise in energy prices has increased the costs of making and shipping an array of goods. Energy-intensive sectors such as the chemicals and metals industries have been particularly hard hit, especially in Germany which had become extremely dependent upon cheap Russian natural gas. Policymakers scramble to control situation Faced with surging inflation, developed nations have reverted to supporting their economies just when they were hoping to wean them off aid provided to help with Covid lockdowns. With support for heating costs, cuts to gasoline taxes, price caps and windfall taxes on oil companies, European nations have pulled out the stops to cushion the blow to consumers from higher energy costs. In the United States, Congress passed a US$370 billion investment package called the Inflation Reduction Act that aims to contain health care costs and promote alternative energies. Central banks, meanwhile, are expected to continue their aggressive interest rate hikes. Stock markets have been spooked by the monetary tightening, with the S&P 500 index suffering its worst half-year performance in 14 years. Global slowdown... then recession? There is precious little optimism right now: US consumer confidence is nearly at a record low, while that for German investors is at a two-year low point. The Chinese property market is in a severe crisis, adding to problems caused by strict Covid lockdowns. In Europe, there are worries that if Russia reduces gas deliveries even further there could be shortages and rationing during the coming winter. Coupled with the tightening of monetary policy underway by central banks, fears have been rising of a global recession, although the main forecasters have so far discounted this possibility. That is because there are also signs of resilience in the global economy. The labour markets in both Europe and the United States remain strong. The Biden administration has pointed to the strength of the US jobs market to argue that the US economy is not in recession despite two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. The mixed signals prompted analysts at HSBC to compare the situation to the thought experiment by Nobel Prize-winning Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger to resolve a quantum paradox in which two states are simultaneously possible. “In the same way that Erwin Schroedinger’s cat was both dead and alive at the same time, the global economy may be both in a recession and not — at least not yet,” they wrote. — AFP",

    content:
      "MANILA, Philippines – Limited practice time will not prevent Barangay Ginebra star Japeth Aguilar from cracking Gilas Pilipinas’ lineup. Aguilar still made the 13-man squad for the Lebanon clash in the fourth window of the FIBA World Cup Asian Qualifiers despite recently being sidelined due to a positive coronavirus result. The high-flying forward missed almost an entire week of practice before he joined the national team in training on Sunday, August 21, after being cleared of COVID-19. Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) executive director Sonny Barrios said Aguilar is a personal choice of head coach Chot Reyes and his coaching staff, which includes Gin Kings’ mentor Tim Cone. “Truth to tell, coach Chot and the other coaches really want him in the lineup,” Barrios said in a mix of Filipino and English during the Philippine Sportswriters Association online forum on Monday. “I talked to him in practice yesterday, he said he is okay. He did some light shooting and he watched the practice and scrimmage intently.” Aguilar is the longest tenured member of this version of the national team as he represented the country in the 2014 and 2019 FIBA World Cup. He last saw action for Gilas Pilipinas in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, helping the team win a 13th straight gold medal on home soil. Aside from his experience, Aguilar provides the Nationals length, athleticism, and shot-blocking as he remains one of the most prolific Filipino rim defenders at 35 years old. The 6-foot-9 forward is coming off one of his best conferences in the PBA, averaging 17.1 points, 8 rebounds, and a league-leading 2.6 blocks in the Philippine Cup. “It is a huge development to have him on board because coach Chot and the coaching staff really like him,” Barrios said. “Of course, particularly Tim Cone because he is a player of Tim Cone.” Aguilar will be joined by his Ginebra teammate Scottie Thompson, Kiefer and Thirdy Ravena, Dwight Ramos, Ray Parks, Chris Newsome, Jamie Malonzo, Roosevelt Adams, Calvin Oftana, and Carl Tamayo. NBA player Jordan Clarkson reinforces the squad alongside 7-foot-3 big man Kai Sotto. Gilas Pilipinas will fly Tuesday midnight to Beirut for its August 25 battle against Lebanon. – Rappler.com",

    content:
      "HONG KONG, Aug 22 — Markets were broadly lower today as the rally from June’s lows runs out of steam owing to renewed concerns about Federal Reserve plans to ramp up interest rates to combat runaway inflation. All eyes are on a symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming where Fed boss Jerome Powell will deliver a speech that will be followed for an idea about the bank’s next moves. A dip in price rises and signs of economic slowdown had raised hopes policymakers would ease up — and possibly cut rates next year — after two successive, 75-basis-point hikes, helping equities rally globally. But that optimism has slowly been eroded in recent weeks as Fed officials, including Powell, have warned that the battle against inflation was far from won, particularly as the jobs market remained resilient. One of the latest was Richmond Fed boss Thomas Barkin, who reasserted his commitment to bringing inflation back to two per cent from the four-decade high of around nine per cent. He said on Friday the policy board would “do what it takes to get there”, but warned: “There’s a path to getting inflation under control but a recession could happen in the process.” Jonathan Millar of Barclays said it was unlikely Powell would signal a slowdown in rate hikes this week. “It does seem like what we’ve heard from Powell so far suggests there’s quite a high bar for them to transition from aggressive hikes” to 25 basis points. “One thing they definitely want to communicate is that they remain very much focused on issues with price stability and that they will react very cautiously to any signs of improvements in the inflation data.” And National Australia Bank’s Rodrigo Catril added that the Fed chief will likely say that “while we may be close to the end of the beginning of the current tightening cycle, we are still a long way from the end”. All three main indexes on Wall Street fell Friday and Asia followed suit in early trade. Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Mumbai, Taipei, Manila and Jakarta dropped. However, Shanghai rose after China’s central bank cut prime loan rates as it tries to bolster the world’s second-biggest economy, which has been ravaged by lockdowns across the country as part of leaders’ zero-Covid strategy. Singapore, Bangkok and Wellington also edged up. London, Paris and Frankfurt all fell at the open. The prospect of more US hikes to come has given another boost to the dollar, which rallied against the yen and is approaching the 140 yen mark for the first time in 24 years. The stronger greenback was helping to keep oil prices down, while downward pressure was being enhanced by speculation rising about a possible Iran nuclear deal that could ease a supply crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both main contracts lost more than one per cent today and have wiped out all the gains seen in reaction to the start of conflict in eastern Europe. “The global balance for the remainder of the year is not as tight as many were expecting, with Russian supply holding up well,” said Warren Patterson, of ING Groep NV. “While it may take several months for Iran to get production back to pre-sanction levels in the event of a deal, in the short term, they should still be able to boost exports by relying on storage.” — AFP",

      "Sanju Samson credits IPL captaincy stint: The Indian wicket-keeper batter believes he has benefited from the Indian Premier League. India wicket-keeper batter Sanju Samson believes in looking for positives in all life and career situations. Samson, 27, was referring to playing only 22 international matches across formats despite debuting seven years ago. While playing even one match for India is a dream for thousands of cricketers around the country, 16 T20Is and six ODIs are considered less for Samson primarily due to his sheer talent. Often criticized for not doing justice to his potential across formats, Samson had scored a match-winning 43* (39) including playing the winning shot in a 162-run chase in the second ODI against Zimbabwe on Saturday. The first time’s always special. pic.twitter.com/C4Xw9ETKn6 — Rajasthan Royals (@rajasthanroyals) August 20, 2022 “I am a believer that whatever you go through in your career, you have to take it in a positive manner. I really enjoyed playing domestic cricket in the last four-five years. It is challenging to do well there and that has made me be a better player,” Samson told the host broadcaster before the start of the third ODI in Harare. Sanju Samson credits IPL captaincy stint for evolving as a cricketer A regular face in the Indian Premier League, Samson has credited not just playing but leading in the biggest T20 tournament around the world as a reason behind his evolution as a cricketer. “It has changed my perspective towards cricket. Earlier, I used to think only about my batting, my game. Captaincy helps bring about a different mindset – think about others as well apart from your game,” Samson added. Been leading Rajasthan Royals for a couple of seasons now, Samson had powered them to the final of IPL 2022 but couldn’t get past champions Gujarat Titans in the last match. Samson, who enjoys a loyal fan-base across social media platforms, enjoys an equally solid fan-following from the stands as well. Expressing surprise at the same for someone who hasn’t played a lot of international cricket, Samson acknowledged his fellow Malayalis for supporting him. “I feel surprised that despite playing very little for India, I get good support. I feel there are a lot more Malayalis as I hear cheers of ‘Chetta, Chetta’ which makes me feel proud. I am really proud to be a Malayali and represent my country as a Malayali cricketer,” Samson concluded.

      "Gnosis is an open-source and decentralized prediction market platform built on the Ethereum blockchain. Described as \"crowdsourced wisdom\" in the Gnosis whitepaper, prediction markets allow users to speculate on any event, sports, political, etc. and utilize user predictions to aggregate information about future events. Moreover, Gnosis is creating an infrastructure layer to enable developers to build their own prediction market apps. The Gnosis protocol has a dual token system, with GNO and OWL tokens to power the platform. Read on for relevant information about the Gnosis protocol and an extensive breakdown of its technology, and get a quick tutorial on why, where, and how to buy Gnosis online in a few simple steps. Let’s get right to it!  What Is Gnosis Gnosis homepage Gnosis is a permissionless, decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum blockchain. It's an open-source platform where users can speculate and bet on any event, news, or arbitrary outcome. Gnosis enables users to trade tokens representing event outcomes on an open market. As the events unfold, and the outcome becomes clear, Gnosis tokens gain or lose value depending on the user's prediction. The Gnosis protocol aims to establish the global standard in prediction markets and provide users with reliable forecasting tools. It provides an infrastructure for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to function as forecasting tools, sources of information, and standards for predictive assets. Gnosis aggregates public opinion combined with data from AI (Artificial Intelligence) agents in an uncensored source to build an unbiased market for data collection and future estimates that could have applications in finance, government, and other sectors. GNO and OWL tokens power Gnosis. GNO is an ERC20 token used to reward Gnosis users. Gnosis tokens (GNO) are used to generate OWL tokens, the primary mode of payment on the platform. What Is Prediction Market To better understand how Gnosis works, we'll delineate a prediction market and how it works. Simply put, it's a market where users can place bets on future events. However, Gnosis has much more utility than placing bets on sports, news, or political events. Prediction markets collect information about the outcome of future events by incentivizing traders to update a data point accurately. Prediction markets take advantage of the wisdom of crowds, i.e., the belief that collective predictions of market participants are usually more accurate and balanced than that of a single expert. Traders bet on what they believe is the most likely outcome, thereby increasing or decreasing the price of that outcome. A decentralized prediction market is a prediction market operating through blockchain-based smart contracts that can self-execute to distribute payoffs without the control of any centralized authority. Prediction markets are effective as a prognostic tool for topics like climate change, epidemics, price forecasting, insurance, etc. They are also used in the financial sector in probabilistically determining the future prices of assets. How Does Gnosis Market Work Gnosis price page Gnosis comprises three separate development layers, such as: Gnosis Core Layer: It's the foundational layer that contains smart contracts for market mechanisms, outcome tokens, etc., on the Gnosis platform.Gnosis Service Layer: It's the platform's second layer that provides resources for consumer applications and implementing tools such as chatbots and stablecoins.Gnosis Application Layer: It's built on top of the Service and Core layers and consists of front-end tools such as apps, etc., that can be built by the Gnosis teams and third-party developers. Gnosis uses the following platforms to achieve its goals: The Apollo Network: It allows users to create their own tokens representing information, incentives, or ideas and a market for any arbitrary event where users can buy or sell positions to speculate on the outcome. Certain outcomes are more likely to happen, increasing the related tokens' value. Once the event has been finalized, the tokens representing the final outcome receive the total value of the bets, while the tokens representing a different outcome use their value.DutchX: A decentralized exchange where users can trade and auction off their tokens.Gnosis Safe: It's a cryptocurrency wallet and browser used to interact with the Ethereum DApps. It enables individuals and businesses to set up multi-signature wallets to store their digital assets securely. This Gnosis wallet interacts smoothly with most popular DeFi protocols and is available for Android and iOS or as a Chrome browser extension. Gnosis History The Gnosis protocol was co-founded by Martin Köppelmann and Stefan George in 2015. It was one of the first projects backed by Ethereum-focused incubator, Consensys. The company held an ICO in 2017 and raised over USD12.5 million by selling 4 percent of the token supply. The ICO was very popular, and the sale ended in less than 15 minutes. In late 2017, Gnosis' testnet Olympia was launched, and in 2018, Apollo, DutchX, and Gnosis Safe were launched. Gnosis (GNO) Tokenomics Gnosis uses two native tokens: Gnosis (GNO) and OWL. GNO is an ERC-20 token, with a total supply of 10 million tokens created during the IC sale in April 2017. The OWL token is used to reward users who stake GNO tokens, with one OWL being equal to $1. The staking rewards depend on the lock-in period and the OWL tokens' supply. OWL tokens are also the preferred mode of payment on the platform. The GNO tokens' circulating supply is 2,579,589 tokens, and the total supply is 3,000,000 tokens. To check the live price of Gnosis, click on Gnosis price.The Gnosis (GNO) token reached its all-time high of USD 575.77 in January 2022 and has decreased significantly since then, like the entire cryptocurrency market. Gnosis is very popular amongst users so you can trade GNO on most major cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide, including Binance, Huobi Global, Kraken, etc. You can also buy Gnosis (GNO) on decentralized exchanges such as UniSwap. Now, let's learn how to buy Gnosis tokens in a few simple steps. How to Buy Gnosis on Binance Binance is one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges in terms of the trading volume. The exchange makes trading cryptocurrencies simple and affordable. It allows users to buy cryptocurrencies using fiat money, credit or debit card, bank account, etc. Binance offers an easy-t0-use interface, low trading fees, and multiple trading options such as margin, leveraged, staking, etc., making Binance one of the most popular and widely used crypto exchanges worldwide. It's not possible to buy Gnosis directly on Binance, but you can buy a major cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT with a credit card or debit card on Binance and then exchange it for Gnosis. Follow our step-by-step guide on how to buy Gnosis on Binance: Create a Binance Account To buy Gnosis (GNO) tokens, you must create a retail investor account on Binance. All you need to register your Binance account is a valid email address and a mobile phone number. After creating your account, you must complete the KYC verification with a valid photo ID and a live photograph. The verification process only takes a few minutes, and you can start trading GNO or any other digital currency of your choice. Deposit Funds To buy Gnosis (GNO), you must add funds to your Binance account. Binance supports fiat money such as USD, GBP, EUR, etc., and several deposit methods like a debit card, credit card, bank transfer, wire transfer, etc. You can choose your preferred payment method for buying Gnosis. Binance has very low fees for trading GNO or any other cryptocurrencies, but trading fees vary for various payment methods. Once you've added sufficient funds to your Binance wallet, you're one step closer to buying Gnosis (GNO). Purchase GNOSIS (GNO) To trade Gnosis on Binance, you must first acquire a major currency such as Ethereum, USDT, etc. You can buy USDT either through the funds deposited into your account or deposit USDT from your personal crypto wallet into your Binance wallet. While depositing, ensure to enter the correct crypto wallet address and select the suitable chain, so your funds don't get lost. On the \"Markets\" page, search for GNO and select Gnosis (GNO/USDT). Enter the amount of USDT you wish to buy GNO for and enter the price of the Gnosis token if you want to place a limit order. You can also place a market order to buy Gnosis at the current market price. Once you click \"buy,\" the order will be executed instantly, and the tokens will reflect in your Binance wallet. You've managed to buy GNO on the Binance exchange in a few easy steps. You can also use the Binance mobile app to buy GNO similarly. How to Buy Gnosis on Huobi Global Huobi Global is one of the world's largest exchanges that supports an impressive array of trading pairs and cryptocurrencies. It enables you to easily purchase GNO or other cryptocurrencies through fiat money or digital currency on the exchange. Follow our step-by-step guide for buying GNO on Huobi Global: Create a Huobi Global Account To buy GNO on Huobi Global, you must create a retail investor account on the exchange. You must provide a valid email address to create an account. Once the account is created, you must provide a valid ID and a live photograph to complete your KYC verification in compliance with the Securities Exchange Commission regulations. Once you complete your KYC, your account will get activated within a few minutes, and you can trade GNO and other cryptocurrencies on the exchange. Consider that a decentralized exchange like UniSwap doesn't require a KYC verification. Deposit Funds The next step is to deposit funds into your Huobi Global wallet. You can choose different ways to fund your Huobi Global wallet. Huobi Global supports fiat currencies and deposit methods like credit or debit card, bank transfer, wire transfer, P2P transfers, etc. You can choose your preferred payment method for buying Gnosis. Add funds to your \"Fiat Account\" under the \"Balance\" tab. If you deposit USD into your Huobi Global wallet, it will show as HUSD.  The exchange charges a small deposit fee for fiat deposits, but no fee is charged for the direct deposit of crypto assets into the wallet. Buy GNO Once you've successfully added funds to your Huobi wallet, the next step is to buy USDT or BTC, as these are the only two trading pairs for GNO available on the exchange. You can use the HUSD to buy the required amount of USDT or BTC. After buying USDT, go to markets and enter GNO/USDT in the search bar. Enter the amount of USDT you wish to buy GNO for and place a market order for purchasing GNO. The order will be fulfilled instantly, and the GNO tokens will be reflected in your Spot Wallet. Now you know how to buy GNO or any other cryptocurrencies of your choice across two of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges. You can also buy GNO on any decentralized exchange that supports ERC-20 tokens. Note: You can sell Gnosis with the exchange you bought it through. Storing GNO Tokens Once you've managed to buy GNO or another digital asset of your choice, the next important step is to store your crypto tokens in a secure wallet that supports Gnosis. While cryptocurrency exchanges offer a digital wallet of their own, significant risks such as cyber-attacks, hacks, etc., are associated with these wallets that make your investments vulnerable. Binance provides its own cryptocurrency wallet, but it has also partnered with Trust Wallet to additionally secure user funds. You can easily transfer crypto brought on Binance to your Trust Wallet. Tip: remember to write down your passphrase provided by Trust and keep it safe, as it'll help you gain access to your wallet if you forget your PIN. After your purchase, you can choose to store your GNO in different kinds of crypto wallets, such as: Software Wallet: These are also known as hot wallets as they are always connected to the internet. The strength of software wallets lies in their flexibility and ease of use. A software wallet is the most easy-to-set-up crypto wallet and lets you easily interact with several decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. However, these wallets are vulnerable to security leaks because they're hosted online—like your bank accounts. So, if you want to keep your private keys in software wallets, conduct due diligence before choosing a wallet to avoid security issues. We recommend a platform that offers 2-factor authentication as an extra layer of security.There are many software wallets available for free download online. CoinStats Wallet is one of the most secure software wallets. It helps you store your GNO and other assets safely and monitor your assets' growth in real-time. Other examples of software wallets include the Trust Wallet and Metamask.Hardware Wallet: A hardware wallet is a device that stores the private keys you need to receive or send crypto. Hardware wallets are usually considered the safest way to store your crypto assets as they offer offline storage, thereby significantly reducing the risks of a hack. They are secured by a pin and will erase all information after many failed attempts, preventing physical theft. Hardware wallets also let you sign and confirm transactions on the blockchain, giving you an extra layer of protection against cyber attacks.Hardware wallets are suitable for investors with a long-term investment strategy.Ledger Nano S, and Ledger Nano X, are arguably the most secure hardware wallets letting you securely manage your Gnosis tokens. Conclusion Gnosis offers the infrastructure for prediction market applications. It also provides Dutch Exchange, the Gnosis Safe, a secure way to manage digital assets, and robust tooling allowing anyone to use customized forecasting applications to make any arbitrary event tradeable.

      "If you want everyone to know you’re busy, tapping away at your mechanical gaming keyboard is one way to do it. Aside from being notoriously clicky while typing, mechanical keyboards are the ultimate choice for PC users. Once you’ve settled on your mouse , mouse pad , headset and cable organisers , it’s time to start thinking about that backlit keyboard that will complete your gaming set-up . Table of Contents A mechanical keyboard is a popular and classic choice that features raised, spring loaded keys. Unlike membrane keyboards, which are commonly seen on laptops, typing on its keys tends to be much louder but more accurate, making it a much more efficient choice for first-person shooters such as Fortnite or Apex Legends . You see, a mechanical keyboard uses high-quality mechanical switches (hence the name), instead of relying on cheap, rubber dome switches. Overall, they’re more responsive and durable, but heavier to cart around. However, they’re also built to last years, in comparison to membrane keyboards that tend to wear down faster. Since we gamers are big on personalisation, an added bonus for mechanical keyboards is their customisation potential. It’s usually easy to remove its keys and replace them with colourful, nicer-looking ones. But, keep in mind that mechanical keyboards can be harder to clean thanks to the raised keys, as well as heavier, louder and more expensive. The cleaning isn’t hard to solve if you have a cordless air duster , though. Looks aside, figuring out which mechanical keyboard to take home is always a doozy. We think that the best place to start is to ask yourself whether you want a wired or wireless one. Most options on the market tend to be wired, which isn’t a problem for most with stationary PC set-ups. But those of you who use a laptop with a limited number of USB ports might want to consider a wireless keyboard instead. Regardless of your preference, make sure you check on the keyboard’s compatibility with your computer before proceeding to checkout. Next you’ll want to consider what size keyboard you want. Each keyboard size differs in its layout, and ultimately, the number of keys available. While a full-sized keyboard can save you from making this decision, you might want a smaller board due to limited desk space. Most tend to agree that a tenkeyless keyboard is a perfect choice. It sports 87 keys, is compact and comfortable and typically includes all of the necessary keys you need to perform basic computer actions. However, tenkeyless keyboards notably lack a number pad, which may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. Another popular size is known as a 60% keyboard . These keyboards are sometimes referred to as “mini keyboards” and are quite common in the wild thanks to their easy customisation capabilities. The only catch is that they tend to lack not just the numpad, but function keys, home cluster and arrow keys. Once you’ve settled on your size, consider whether you want a tactile or linear keyboard. Generally speaking, tactile keyboards are those loud ones you hear office workers drumming their fingers against and are distinguished by the small bump you feel when you press down on its keys. Meanwhile, linear keyboards are named for the smooth, up/down movement it takes the press the switches. They’re much quieter than tactile keyboards and require less effort to press the keys. Some gamers prefer softer, light touch keys, that allow them to glide over the board to enter any commands without a second thought. If you opt for a linear keyboard, you won’t need to press down hard on its keys, whereas you would have to if you’re using a tactile one. From there, you might have noticed the word “Cherry MX Switch” included in the description of various keyboards you’ve been researching. If this concept has you scratching your head, we’ve gone ahead and broken it down for you: One of the last things you’ll want to pay attention to is your keyboard’s rollover capability a.k.a how many keys can your keyboard recognise at one time. Most keyboards tend to recognise a maximum of three key combinations at the same time, whereas when you’re gaming you might need to press four or more. Other things you can keep in mind are whether that keyboard features any wrist rests that offer ergonomic support or if it comes with a mouse as a bundle. We always love getting more bang for our buck. This mechanical keyboard has an insane 13,300 reviews on Amazon and we think that sums itself up as one of the best choices you can get your Cheetos-covered mitts on. Not only is it full-sized, linear and with Cherry MX Red switches, but it also has an ergonomic wrist rest for you to lean on during cutscenes. Some reviewers have remarked that it’s a fantastic tactile choice with the right amount of resistance and the perfect typing angle. Where to buy Amazon ($299.12) | jw ($219) Those who love to mix business with pleasure will appreciate a mechanical keyboard that features a brown switch, much like this Logitech one. While it’s all well and good to own a gaming-exclusive keyboard, it does ease the ol’ bank account to just get one that can do it all. This full-sized mechanical keyboard is perfect for getting work done during daylight before switching over to RGB-lit gaming at night. Its tactile keys will let you tap away loud and proud at full speed. Where to buy Amazon ($123) | Bing Lee ($129) | eBay ($168) Our Editor David reviewed this HyperX keyboard late last year and while it lacks some bells and whistles, this HyperX tenkeyless keyboard has everything you’d want from a gaming keyboard. This sturdy board is made from aircraft-grade aluminium, which basically means it’s strong and heavy enough to withstand some aggressive tapping if you’re in the middle of a Halo Infinite match. This gaming keyboard features X1 Cherry Red switches which are perfect for letting your fingers slide from one key to another or if you’re just a trigger-happy son-of-a-bitch. However, you can also get a stiffer Blue or Aqua switch if you prefer. We’re also a fan of its three adjustable angles, so you can type to your comfort and ditch that pesky carpal tunnel syndrome. Where to buy Amazon ($134) | eBay ($151.90) | Mwave ($179) If you’d prefer a much more compact keyboard, you might want to consider something in the 60% mechanical range. Our king, David, also reviewed this particular keyboard earlier this year. Smaller than a tenkeyless keyboard, a 60% sized keyboard lops off the number pad and arrow keys as well as function-specific buttons. While it might take some time to get used to navigating without arrow keys, this gaming keyboard is ideal if you have limited desk space. But don’t worry if there’s a game you’re playing that relies on arrow keys since you can use the letters J, K, L and I to move around. Although, you will have to get used to sitting your pinky on the function key. On the plus side, this Razer board has linear red switches which make for a silent, effortless typing style that shouldn’t piss off anybody trying to watch TV nearby. Where to buy Amazon ($159) | Bing Lee ($159) | eBay ($139) If you’d prefer a wireless mechanical gaming keyboard, you can grab this one by Redragon. This wireless keyboard features brown switches, which are ideal for typing or gaming, so it’ll get plenty of use for both work and play. Its smaller size also makes it a great portable option. So if you like to do a lot of gaming on a laptop, but can’t stand its membrane keys, then connect this tenkeyless keyboard via Bluetooth, so you can transform into a stealthy sniper post-work. It’s also just a refreshing spin on the classic black style in case you’re a fan of a lighter and brighter look . Where to buy Amazon ($89.99)",

It’s a thought-provoking story that should have every country taking a hard look at its justice system. Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution Crip Camp: A Disability Revolution earned high praise thanks to its inspiring story of a summer camp that helps a group of teenagers with disabilities forge a path towards equality.

      'Maruti Suzuki is betting that a bigger and more fuel efficient version of its small hatchback, Alto, can bring back buyers to a segment that long-dominated Indian roads but has recently lost its popularity to sports-utility vehicles (SUVs). Hatchbacks are the backbone of personal transport in India making up 38% of total car sales but SUVs, with their sporty body styles and in-car connectivity features, took the lead last fiscal year with around a 40% share. India\'s biggest carmaker hopes to arrest this trend by targeting young buyers in large cities with its new Alto which is bigger than its predecessor, has a larger, one litre engine and more features, said Shashank Srivastava, senior executive officer, marketing and sales. "We have a bigger, more powerful car ... and geographically also we are expanding the base," Srivastava told Reuters ahead of the car\'s launch on Thursday. He said about 65% of Alto\'s sales come from smaller cities but with the new model Maruti is targeting buyers in bigger cities between the age of 25 years and 35 years. Maruti, majority-owned by Japan\'s Suzuki Motor Corp, dominates the entry-level, small car segment in India with models like the Alto, which has been a top-seller in the country for several years. But with high inflation and other factors pushing up car prices, growth of small cars has slowed. "The affordability in this segment has come down for various reasons. The sensitivity to price rises is much higher," he said, adding that Alto is the first car for many buyers - a cost-conscious segment that Maruti will continue to target. "This segment will play a very important role in the future", Srivastava said, adding that first time buyers make up 50% of cars sold in the country. Entry-level cars like Alto currently make up about 15% of Maruti\'s total annual sales and Srivastava expects this to grow with the new model. Maruti expects total car sales in India to rise to about 3.7 million this year from about 3.1 million last fiscal year, he said. But this could be impacted by high inflation and material costs, supply chain disruptions, as well as new regulations.',

      "Tech giant Apple is reportedly planning to show search ads in its Maps app on the iPhone starting next year. In his newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that he believes the engineering work is already underway, reports MacRumors. “I believe the engineering work is already underway to launch search ads in the Apple Maps app, and we should begin to see it be implemented sometime next year,” wrote Gurman, in the subscriber-only version of his “Power On” newsletter. Ads in the Apple Maps app would not be the traditional banner ads that you see on websites but rather paid search results, the report said. For example, a fast food chain could pay Apple to appear near the top of the results when a user searches for “burgers” or “fries”. Many similar apps already offer search ads, including Google Maps, Waze, and Yelp. Apple already displays search ads in the App Store, allowing developers to pay to promote their apps to users who search for relevant keywords. The tech giant is also planning to show ads in the App Store’s “Today” tab and in a new “You Might Also Like” section at the bottom of app listings, while banner ads are displayed in Apple’s News and Stocks apps. Last week, Gurman said Apple plans to expand its advertising business over time significantly. In his newsletter, he said that Apple’s advertising division is generating about $4 billion in revenue annually and that Apple’s advertising chief Todd Teresi wants to increase that figure to at least $10 billion annually over time.

      "NEW YORK, Aug 22 — Britain’s Cineworld said today it was considering options including a possible bankruptcy filing in the United States as the world’s second-largest cinema chain operator struggles with near term liquidity. “Cineworld would expect to maintain its operations in the ordinary course until and following any filing,” it said in a statement. Shares of the London-listed company plunged to a record low on Friday after a Wall Street Journal report said it was preparing to file for bankruptcy in the United States and Britain. Cineworld said on Wednesday said it was looking at various options to obtain liquidity and potentially restructure its debt-ladden balance sheet through a deleveraging transaction, which would lead to very significant dilution of existing equity interests in Cineworld. The Brentford-based company, founded by Steve Wiener in 1995, said it was in talks with many of its major stakeholders including lenders and legal and financial advisers. Currently, Cineworld and Regal theatres globally are open for business as usual, the company added. — Reuters",

      "Socar , South Korea’s largest car-sharing startup, tumbled in its Seoul stock market debut Monday even after pricing shares below the bottom end of a marketed range. Shares of Socar rose 1.25% from its IPO price of 28,000 won ($21.10) in the initial minutes of the debut, before tumbling to 26,300 won and giving the firm a market cap of $642 million. Last week, Socar cut its targeted IPO offering to 102 billion won ($78.1 million), giving the car-sharing company a valuation of 966.5 billion won ($731 million) before the start of trading. Socar’s debut comes amid a sluggish period in the IPO market in South Korea that has prompted a series of Korean companies to delay their listing plans. Analysts attributed the muted performance of Socar’s debut day to an expensive valuation and slowdown in the IPO market that is reeling from the global economic downturn. Jaeuk Park, CEO of Socar, told TechCrunch earlier that the company was pushing ahead with its listing plans because it was confident in its performance and expected to generate both operating profits and net profits by the end of this year. Rather than waiting for the stock market to recover for a higher valuation for the next two to three years, he said, the Korean mobility startup prioritized investment in organic/ inorganic growth with the IPO proceeds. “First off, Socar’s growth is faster than expected in the face of re-opening [after the COVID-19 pandemic],” Park said. “The stock market is expected to be tough for the time being, but the mobility industry will grow rapidly that we can’t miss this critical time; we will focus on accelerating mergers and acquisitions and investments in new businesses and technology.” The company plans to beef up its services and geographic expansion efforts via acquisitions to become a mobility super-app with the goal of posting 1 trillion won ($748 million) of revenue by 2025, up from 289 billion won last year, Park continued. It aims to reach 30% or more annual revenue growth by 2025, he added. Socar, the first and only unicorn mobility startup in South Korea, aims to become the first listed profitable unicorn company, Park noted. Socar, backed by SoftBank, and Korean strategic investor SK Inc, entered the unicorn club with roughly 183.2 billion won ($150 million) funding at a 1.3 trillion won (approximately $1 billion) in March from Lotte Rental, the rental car unit of South Korean Lotte Group. The startup raised a total of 379.7 billion won ($ 284.2million) since its inception in 2011 before its IPO. The company’s major shareholders, including SoftBank, SK Inc, Lotte Rental and Altos Ventures, will hold their stake since they agreed to a lock-up period of up to six months. The 11-year-old firm, which started the car-sharing service with 100 rental cars in Jeju, now manages a fleet of more than 19,000 vehicles across the country, offering services, including car-sharing, car-hailing, electric bicycle rental, parking, vehicle management and vehicle maintenance. It will launch its transportation super-app later this year, providing all-in-one mobility services. Additionally, Socar is building an ecosystem for future mobility, including an autonomous driving platform, charging stations service for electric cars and micro-mobility. Park said in an interview that Socar wants to enter the Southeast Asia market with its new business, fleet management system (FMS) B2B SaaS service that it plans to begin selling later in the fourth quarter of this year. Socar, based on its 19,000 vehicles, has built the FMS technology that uses data such as vehicle location and surroundings to support effective monitoring and control systems, providing accurate information to drivers and management servers. “FMS is different from car-sharing, which has been Socar’s flagship business for the past ten years, and if stabilized, it is a B2B SaaS that guarantees a high-profit ratio,” Park said. Socar claims that the company has captured about 80% of the market share in South Korea, with more than 11.4 million users and 1.4 million monthly active users this year. The Korean car-hailing company has set up Socar Malaysia, a 79% stake owned by SK Inc, and launched services in Malaysia in 2018 and Indonesia in 2020. Socar was founded in 2011 by Lee Jae-woong, who co-founded South Korea’s largest internet portal operator Daum Communications; Daum merged into Kakao in 2014. Jaeuk Park, a serial entrepreneur, who founded VCNC, an operator messaging app for couples called Between, in 2011, sold VCNC to Socar in 2018. After the sale of VCNC, Park joined Socar’s chief strategy officer (CSO) to lead Socar’s ride-hailing business Tada and took on the chief executive officer (CEO) in 2020 after Lee stepped down. Korean game maker Krafton acquired VCNC’s messaging app unit in May 2021, while Viva Republica, a Korean financial super app Toss operator, bought a 60% stake in Tada , the ride-hailing business of VCNC, for an undisclosed amount in October last year. Meanwhile, South Korea’s TMap Mobility, whose investors include Uber Technologies and SK Inc’s investment firm SK Square, said Monday it has raised $149.2 million (200 billion won) from strategic investor KB Bank. Another Korean car-hailing platform Kakao Mobility, which also had planned an IPO between 2022 and 2023, said last week it has terminated its sale talk with Korean private equity firm MBK Partners.",

      "Dylan Walsh Photo by Mario Hommes/DeFodi Images via Getty Images Newcastle United are now reportedly pushing to sign Borussia Monchengladbach star Manu Kone , a player Marcelo Bielsa was once desperate to have at Leeds United. According to L’Equipe via GFFN , the Magpies are intent on signing the 21-year-old France international, with Eddie Howe’s side willing to spend as much as €35m (£30m) to secure the midfielder’s services this summer, with Kone last season establishing himself as one of the Bundesliga’s most exciting talents. The youngster has come a long way in the last 12 months, with Kone becoming a regular for Gladbach last season and becoming a France U-21 international, with Leeds seemingly missing out on a diamond following reports in 2020 that Bielsa was eager to sign the midfielder after the Whites promotion back to the Premier League. Now, it appears that Newcastle could sign Kone two years after Leeds missed out on the youngster, who TuttoMerctoWeb once likened to Juventus star Paul Pogba given how versatile the Bundesliga star is in the midfielder and his physical frame. Newcastle and Leeds are now both rushing to try and sign 'terrific' £6m midfielder Newcastle want to sign Manchester United talent, Paratici and Orta reluctant to pay £14m As per L’Equipe, whilst a formal offer is yet to be made, late activity in the window could see Newcastle table a bid for Kone, who would be an excellent addition to the Toon’s squad and another piece of Howe’s long-term vision for the northeast side, who this weekend secured an incredible 3-3 draw against English champions Manchester City. Indeed, whilst Kone would be an expensive outlay for Newcastle, pairing the midfielder alongside Bruno Guimaraes could form an excellent spine for the Magpies going forward, and the midfielder himself could be very open to a move to the Premier League with Howe’s side. Newcastle should be pushing hard to sign Kone this summer Photo by Christian Verheyen/Borussia Moenchengladbach via Getty Images Newcastle’s business this summer has been oddly underwhelming despite the massive improvements the likes of Nick Pope and Sven Botman have already made to the team this season, and adding Kone to the mix could complete an outstanding window of business for the English side. Whilst Kone is only 21, the midfielder has the potential to become a key staple for Newcastle in the years to come, and the youngster could be an ideal signing that will excite supporters this season, especially alongside Guimaraes in the centre of the Magpies park.

Among UK companies with reports and updates are Cineworld group and Vodafone. Read the Monday 22 August Business Live blog below. > If you are using our app or a third-party site click here to read Business Live Harry Wise Host commentator Mike Sheen Host commentator 08:32 Market open: FTSE 100 down 0.3%; FTSE 250 off 0.2% London-listed stocks have opened lower this morning, with oil stocks leading losses, as a bout of risk aversion hit global markets on concerns over aggressive rate hikes by major central banks. The FTSE 100 is down 0.3 per cent, with oil majors Shell and BP down 1.1 per cent and 1.3 per cnet, respectively, as crude prices slumped more than 2 per cent on worries about the weakening global economic outlook and hit to fuel demand. Cineworld is up 10.1 per cent after slumping almost 60 per cent to a record low on Friday, as the world\'s second-largest cinema chain operator said it was considering options including a possible bankruptcy filing in the US as it struggles with near-term liquidity. Vodafone has edged up 0.5 per cent after it said that it would sell its Hungarian business for $1.8billion in cash. 08:23 RUTH SUNDERLAND: Energy bills burning firms When regulator Ofgem announces a new energy cap for households this week, spare a thought for the small and medium firms that are the backbone of the economy. Domestic consumers will see a big hike in bills, but the situation is even worse for entrepreneurs. They don\'t even have the limited protection of a cap on prices and are entirely at the mercy of the market.

Amazon shrinks Fresh till-less store expansion plans The US giant opened its first UK shop under the Amazon Fresh brand in Ealing, west London, last year and has 19 in total. This is Money 08:08 Summer lethargy weighs on sentiment Head of markets at interactive investor Richard Hunter: \'The recent rally ran out of steam as investors braced for the latest Federal Reserve pronouncements later this week. \'The likely highlight of the annual Jackson Hole symposium will be a speech from Fed Chair Powell, where the committee’s latest thinking is likely to be unveiled. While no material change is expected from the current path of interest rate rises, there may be an update on emerging economic data which is suggesting that the hikes already undertaken are beginning to have an impact. \'That being said, there have also been lagging indicators such as the latest jobs numbers and inflation print which suggest that the economy remains robust enough to withstand the current round of rises, even though this will not become apparent until after the event, given the trailing nature of most economic data. \'Therein lies the difficulty of the Fed’s current strategy. It remains committed to tackling inflation head on, but is also aware that an overtightening of the screws could lead the world’s largest economy into a slowdown. At the same time, persistent inflation is likely to weigh on corporate margins although the recent reporting season showed that many companies are holding up relatively well. \'The current delicacy of this balancing act was enough to put the brakes on a recently recovering Wall Street, with each of the major indices ending the week on a negative note. In the year to date, the Dow Jones is now down by 7%, while the S&P500 and Nasdaq have shed 11% and 19% respectively. \'Asian markets were mixed despite the easing of financial conditions in China, where the central bank is aiming to encourage lending in an effort to boost an ailing economy. Quite apart from the impact of the latest Covid-19 variant which has resulted in several lockdowns, the property market remains under severe pressure and there was also a power shortage in a key manufacturing region. \'The general summer lethargy also weighed on sentiment in UK markets, where further monetary tightening is also likely to continue. The more recent strength of the US Dollar as a haven investment has pulled the rug from sterling, which has had the impact of underpinning the premier index which derives much of its income from overseas, thus making those earnings more valuable in translation. The FTSE100 remains up by 2% in the year to date despite a tepid opening today, although the FTSE250, a more representative barometer of the UK economy as a whole, continues its weakness and has lost 15.5% so far this year. \'In early exchanges, a further leg down in the oil price on demand concerns weighed on BP and Shell, with some weakness in recovery stocks such as International Consolidated Airlines offset slightly by some tentative buying within defensives.\' 07:48 Bosses at UK\'s biggest listed companies saw average pay soar to £3.41m last year Bosses at the UK\'s biggest listed companies saw their average pay soar to £3.41million last year, according to figures. The median pay package for FTSE 100 chief executives was up by 39 per cent from £2.46million the year before, data compiled by the High Pay Centre and the TUC showed. It comes days after separate figures showed that, after accounting for inflation, UK workers\' average pay fell by 4.1 per cent in the second quarter – the biggest fall in records dating back two decades.

    content:
      "If you want everyone to know you’re busy, tapping away at your mechanical gaming keyboard is one way to do it. Aside from being notoriously clicky while typing, mechanical keyboards are the ultimate choice for PC users. Once you’ve settled on your mouse , mouse pad , headset and cable organisers , it’s time to start thinking about that backlit keyboard that will complete your gaming set-up . Table of Contents A mechanical keyboard is a popular and classic choice that features raised, spring loaded keys. Unlike membrane keyboards, which are commonly seen on laptops, typing on its keys tends to be much louder but more accurate, making it a much more efficient choice for first-person shooters such as Fortnite or Apex Legends . You see, a mechanical keyboard uses high-quality mechanical switches (hence the name), instead of relying on cheap, rubber dome switches. Overall, they’re more responsive and durable, but heavier to cart around. However, they’re also built to last years, in comparison to membrane keyboards that tend to wear down faster. Since we gamers are big on personalisation, an added bonus for mechanical keyboards is their customisation potential. It’s usually easy to remove its keys and replace them with colourful, nicer-looking ones. But, keep in mind that mechanical keyboards can be harder to clean thanks to the raised keys, as well as heavier, louder and more expensive. The cleaning isn’t hard to solve if you have a cordless air duster , though. Looks aside, figuring out which mechanical keyboard to take home is always a doozy. We think that the best place to start is to ask yourself whether you want a wired or wireless one. Most options on the market tend to be wired, which isn’t a problem for most with stationary PC set-ups. But those of you who use a laptop with a limited number of USB ports might want to consider a wireless keyboard instead. Regardless of your preference, make sure you check on the keyboard’s compatibility with your computer before proceeding to checkout. Next you’ll want to consider what size keyboard you want. Each keyboard size differs in its layout, and ultimately, the number of keys available. While a full-sized keyboard can save you from making this decision, you might want a smaller board due to limited desk space. Most tend to agree that a tenkeyless keyboard is a perfect choice. It sports 87 keys, is compact and comfortable and typically includes all of the necessary keys you need to perform basic computer actions. However, tenkeyless keyboards notably lack a number pad, which may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. Another popular size is known as a 60% keyboard . These keyboards are sometimes referred to as “mini keyboards” and are quite common in the wild thanks to their easy customisation capabilities. The only catch is that they tend to lack not just the numpad, but function keys, home cluster and arrow keys. Once you’ve settled on your size, consider whether you want a tactile or linear keyboard. Generally speaking, tactile keyboards are those loud ones you hear office workers drumming their fingers against and are distinguished by the small bump you feel when you press down on its keys. Meanwhile, linear keyboards are named for the smooth, up/down movement it takes the press the switches. They’re much quieter than tactile keyboards and require less effort to press the keys. Some gamers prefer softer, light touch keys, that allow them to glide over the board to enter any commands without a second thought. If you opt for a linear keyboard, you won’t need to press down hard on its keys, whereas you would have to if you’re using a tactile one. From there, you might have noticed the word “Cherry MX Switch” included in the description of various keyboards you’ve been researching. If this concept has you scratching your head, we’ve gone ahead and broken it down for you: One of the last things you’ll want to pay attention to is your keyboard’s rollover capability a.k.a how many keys can your keyboard recognise at one time. Most keyboards tend to recognise a maximum of three key combinations at the same time, whereas when you’re gaming you might need to press four or more. Other things you can keep in mind are whether that keyboard features any wrist rests that offer ergonomic support or if it comes with a mouse as a bundle. We always love getting more bang for our buck. This mechanical keyboard has an insane 13,300 reviews on Amazon and we think that sums itself up as one of the best choices you can get your Cheetos-covered mitts on. Not only is it full-sized, linear and with Cherry MX Red switches, but it also has an ergonomic wrist rest for you to lean on during cutscenes. Some reviewers have remarked that it’s a fantastic tactile choice with the right amount of resistance and the perfect typing angle. Where to buy Amazon ($299.12) | jw ($219) Those who love to mix business with pleasure will appreciate a mechanical keyboard that features a brown switch, much like this Logitech one. While it’s all well and good to own a gaming-exclusive keyboard, it does ease the ol’ bank account to just get one that can do it all. This full-sized mechanical keyboard is perfect for getting work done during daylight before switching over to RGB-lit gaming at night. Its tactile keys will let you tap away loud and proud at full speed. Where to buy Amazon ($123) | Bing Lee ($129) | eBay ($168) Our Editor David reviewed this HyperX keyboard late last year and while it lacks some bells and whistles, this HyperX tenkeyless keyboard has everything you’d want from a gaming keyboard. This sturdy board is made from aircraft-grade aluminium, which basically means it’s strong and heavy enough to withstand some aggressive tapping if you’re in the middle of a Halo Infinite match. This gaming keyboard features X1 Cherry Red switches which are perfect for letting your fingers slide from one key to another or if you’re just a trigger-happy son-of-a-bitch. However, you can also get a stiffer Blue or Aqua switch if you prefer. We’re also a fan of its three adjustable angles, so you can type to your comfort and ditch that pesky carpal tunnel syndrome. Where to buy Amazon ($134) | eBay ($151.90) | Mwave ($179) If you’d prefer a much more compact keyboard, you might want to consider something in the 60% mechanical range. Our king, David, also reviewed this particular keyboard earlier this year. Smaller than a tenkeyless keyboard, a 60% sized keyboard lops off the number pad and arrow keys as well as function-specific buttons. While it might take some time to get used to navigating without arrow keys, this gaming keyboard is ideal if you have limited desk space. But don’t worry if there’s a game you’re playing that relies on arrow keys since you can use the letters J, K, L and I to move around. Although, you will have to get used to sitting your pinky on the function key. On the plus side, this Razer board has linear red switches which make for a silent, effortless typing style that shouldn’t piss off anybody trying to watch TV nearby. Where to buy Amazon ($159) | Bing Lee ($159) | eBay ($139) If you’d prefer a wireless mechanical gaming keyboard, you can grab this one by Redragon. This wireless keyboard features brown switches, which are ideal for typing or gaming, so it’ll get plenty of use for both work and play. Its smaller size also makes it a great portable option. So if you like to do a lot of gaming on a laptop, but can’t stand its membrane keys, then connect this tenkeyless keyboard via Bluetooth, so you can transform into a stealthy sniper post-work. It’s also just a refreshing spin on the classic black style in case you’re a fan of a lighter and brighter look . Where to buy Amazon ($89.99)",

According to the physician, the prolonged use of whitening toothpaste will eventually make teeth colour to turn yellow. In a video shared on his Instagram page, @tolubinutu, the UK-based health expert explained that whitening toothpaste work by removing stains on the surface of our teeth. The stains, he said, could be due to anything ranging from our foods to drinks. He added that chronic coffee drinkers and smokers are also prone to developing teeth stains. He said, “The reason whitening toothpaste can remove these stains better than regular toothpaste is that whitening toothpaste is more abrasive. “This means that they have ‘crunchy’ particles that can abrade and remove those stubborn stains on the teeth.” He, however, noted that whitening toothpaste works like sandpaper and according to him, that is where the problem arises. “Because of their abrasiveness, prolonged or repeated use of whitening toothpaste will not only remove stains, but it will start to remove the enamel of the teeth (that is the outer, whiter part), leaving behind the inner part of the teeth which is yellower than the outer part.” He advised that if a person must use a whitening toothpaste, it must be used sparingly and if a person must whiten their teeth, consulting a dentist for a professional job is necessary. Also, according to a dental health site, getthefloss.com, whitening toothpaste can sometimes make teeth stain worse. According to the site, while whitening toothpaste may remove surface stains it can be abrasive and damage the enamel (the hard outer layer of the tooth), making it even more prone to staining. The site also revealed that whitening toothpaste often doesn’t contain any active whitening ingredients, or they may be missing key ingredients required to maintain healthy teeth such as fluoride.

Some noteworthy startups from earlier Surge cohorts include Doubtnut, Scaler Academy, Khatabook, Bijak, Classplus, Hevo Data, Juno, Atlan, BukuKas, Plum and Apna Club. The fresh cohort includes startups that are attempting to introduce tools to simplify workflows as well as solve bigger challenges including climate change. Sequoia said its cohort includes some startups with whom it partnered when they had no product as well as those being run by repeat founders and entrepreneurs with extensive experience in their respective sectors. These founders include the former CFO of fashion e-commerce platform Nykaa, machine learning engineers who worked on conversational AI at Meta and the first set of engineers of Uber in India. “We continue to be deeply impressed by the ambition and diversity of ideas, as well as the calibre of founders with each cohort. Surge 07 is no exception. We have partnered with all of our companies at their earliest stage of company building, with nearly half of them still in pre-launch at the start of our partnerships,” said Rajan Anandan, Managing Director, Sequoia India & Southeast Asia, and Surge, in a prepared statement. “Our founders bring with them a wealth of experience and creativity, and we believe that these dreamers, innovators and category creators have the potential to change the future of our region and the world,” he added. A majority of the startups in the new cohort are building for global markets and targeting audiences beyond their headquarters. Nearly half of them have a presence in the U.S. and European markets, Sequoia said. Founders in the seventh cohort of Surge will go through a 16-week hybrid program to get training and mentorship from industry veterans and storied entrepreneurs. Following is the list of startups available in the seventh cohort. One startup in the cohort is currently in the stealth space, but has disclosed that it’s working in the travel space.","pubDate":"2022-08-22 08:19:43","image_url":null,"source_id":"techcrunch","country":["united states of america"],"category":["technology"],"language":"english"},{"title":"9 Board Games That You Need To Play At Least Once","link":"https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/08/board-games-every-gamer-own/","keywords":["In Real Life","affiliate","amazon-partnership","au","betrayal at house on the hill","board games","catan","ebay","ebay-partnership","fantasy flight","game of thrones","gloomhaven","lord of the rings","scythe","settlers of catan","skimlinks","star wars","tapestry"],"creator":["Chris Neill"],"video_url":null,"description":"From all-time strategy classics to epic fantasy quests and titles based on popular movies and TV shows, these are just a few board games that deserve a spot on your shelf. The post 9 Board Games That You Need To Play At Least Once appeared first on Kotaku Australia.","content":"The current range and quality of board games available is pretty astounding. If you walk into any game store and you’ll come face-to-face with a wall of chunky games boxes, each overflowing with maps, dice, card decks and cardboard tokens. Unfortunately, being spoilt for choice is both a blessing and a curse. With so many options available, trying to figure out what title you want to play can feel a bit daunting. Especially if you’re someone who is fairly new to the board game, uh, game. To help you out, we’ve put together a few of our favourite titles that deserve to be part of any collection, from beginner to expert. From all-time strategy classics to epic fantasy quests and titles based on popular movies and TV shows , these are just a few board games that deserve a spot on your shelf (if you can fit them, that is). This article has been updated since its original publication. Team up with your friends to solve a mysterious haunting. Betrayal At House on the Hill has two phases – the first is the “Exploration” phase, where the players build a mansion room by room. Eventually, you’ll trigger the second phase, the “Haunt”, and that’s where the fun starts as you’re beset by supernatural monsters. To make things even more interesting, one of the players is secretly a traitor who takes the side of the monsters and uses the “Exploration” phase to assist their undead master. With the mansion being procedurally generated, there’s a ton of replay value. Unlike the rotting corpses hidden beneath the mansion’s floorboards, every game feels fresh. The variation in monsters is also fun, ranging from ghosts to vampires to dragons. If you’re new to the game (or these types of board games in general) it does come across as a bit overwhelming to master, but it’s surprisingly easy to learn . If you’re a fan of Dungeons & Dragons , there’s an alternate version of Betrayal At House on the Hill that’s themed around the popular tabletop RPG and set in Baldur’s Gate. Where you can buy Betrayal At House on the Hill : Amazon Australia ($69) | Catch ($85) | eBay ($59.99) After years of being out of print, the Dune board game is finally available again and the world is a better place for it. Originally published in 1979 and based on Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi epic, Dune has a reputation for being one of the best board games around. The good news is that it absolutely lives up to the hype. The board game draws a healthy amount from the original novel, putting you in control of one of six factions – House Atreides, House Harkonnen, the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit, the Emperor and the Fremen – as you strategise, fight and scheme your way to controlling the planet Arrakis and its spice melange. Dune is great to play with friends but, much like in the novel, a huge part of the game involves diplomacy, secret alliances and inevitable betrayals. There’s nothing like a fun afternoon of friendly back-stabbing. Dune has mostly aged well, although much like the deserts of Arrakis, there’s a degree of random cruelness that you can’t fully prepare for. Just remember that he who controls the spice controls the universe. Where you can buy Dune : Amazon Australia ($66) | Catch ($65) | eBay ($71.95) While the TV show squandered our collective goodwill over those final seasons, A Game of Thrones has remained a consistent go-to with friends. Choose your House, start manoeuvring your armies to secure as much of the Seven Kingdoms as you can, and finally claim your spot on the Iron Throne. (If you want to play as House Targaryen , you’ll have to grab an expansion pack.) A Game of Thrones is an all-around solid strategy game , the real charm comes from the table politics and scheming. Making deals to crush a specific opponent, only to turn around and stab your ally in the back isn’t just a fun thing to do, it’s an essential tactic. For the A Song of Ice and Fire purists, the game is directly inspired by the books, with this second edition being released the same year the HBO adaptation aired. You can also try to create your own (and much better?) ending to the series. Rob Stark teams up with Stannis Baratheon, sieges Casterly Rock and decimates the Lannisters? Sure, why not? Where you can buy A Game of Thrones : Amazon Australia ($79) | Catch ($82) | eBay ($77.31 with the code PLAU15 ) Gloomhaven is only a few years old, but it’s quickly become one of our favourite board games. A campaign-driven dungeon crawler where you play a mercenary trying to get paid while surviving the dangerous world surrounding Gloomhaven. It plays like a mix of eurogames and dungeon crawlers like HeroQuest , with a lot of different dungeons to explore and an emphasis on tactical decisions. There are almost 100 unique scenarios you can play through, where your every action will determine what happens next. Considering each scenario can take anywhere between one to two hours to complete, you’ve got plenty of game ahead of yourself. There is so much packed into Gloomhaven that it can feel like you’ve barely even scratched the surface of your campaign. Just put aside some time to set it up and clear some space on your shelf because this thing is a beast. It comes with 1,500 cards, and the whole bundle weighs around 10kg. If you’re interested in Gloomhaven , but maybe aren’t keen on the commitment required for both time and physical space, there is an alternative option. Jaws of the Lion is a prequel game that gives you the Gloomhaven experience but with a fraction of the quests. It’s a less intensive way to learn the game and will let you slip straight into Gloomhaven proper once you’re done with it. Where you can buy Gloomhaven : Amazon Australia ($175) | Catch ($185) | eBay ($179.31 with the code PLAU15 ) The Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth does what it says on the box. You, and up to four other friends, play as one of J.R.R. Tolkien’s iconic heroes while questing your way across the realm of Middle-earth, from Gondor to the Grey Mountains. While most of the games on this list are more tactically focused, Journeys in Middle-earth places its focus squarely on adventuring . As you progress you’re able to customise your skills and items, giving you just enough RPG elements that, despite playing pre-set characters, you can still give them your own spin. The game requires a companion app that takes the role of the game master while also tracking your progress and dishing out scenarios that play into the greater campaign. The app also keeps track of your character’s items, which helps alleviate the usually frustrating mess of flipping through a stack of cards to find that one specific piece of equipment. Where you can buy LOTR: Journeys in Middle-earth : Amazon Australia ($149.84) | Catch ($175.85) | eBay ($149.84) Scythe is set in a dieselpunk reimagining of 1920s Europe where you play as one of five nations currently vying for control in a power vacuum created by the closure of The Factory, a capitalistic city-state that previously ruled the region. At first, Scythe does feel a bit complex but once you get the hang of it, you’ll be playing one of the best engine-building games of the last decade. Farm some resources, conquer new territories, recruit new followers and activate some chunky-looking mechs to keep your domain protected. It isn’t particularly combat-heavy and the skirmishes that do occur play through fairly fast. Scythe also has one of the most unique aesthetics of any board game I’ve played and some gorgeous game art by Jakub Rozalski. When we first opened up our copy we spent plenty of time looking through each individual card, completely ignoring the rulebook. Where you can buy Scythe : Amazon Australia ($103.54) | Catch ($100) | eBay ($99.41 with the code PLAU15 ) I’m a firm believer that every household should own a copy of this. Settlers of Catan is one of the all-time classic board games — endlessly replayable and a great place to start for those new to strategy games. The gameplay is pretty straightforward. You’re plopped onto the randomly generated isle Catan and need to collect as many different types of resources as possible. From there, you’ll combine those resources to build new settlements, upgrade existing ones and increase your domain by laying down some roads. It’s simple to play, but the strategic trading element keeps it consistently interesting. One turn you’ll be rolling in wheat, and the next you’ll be trading all of your wood to get a single piece. Where you can buy The Settlers of Catan : Amazon Australia ($45) | Catch ($49) | eBay ($38.99) The set-up for Star Wars Rebellion is pretty simple: It is a period of civil war, so pick a side . The game is built around a series of skirmishes and missions that are all led by classic Star Wars heroes and villains. If you’re playing as the Empire, your goal is to sniff out the Rebel Alliance’s base and wipe it from existence. As the Rebels, your goal is to raise your reputation throughout the galaxy, drawing as many planets to your side as possible and strategically striking the Empire’s resources. You also get a lot of great minis, ranging from Stormtroopers to X-Wings to Star Destroyers. You even get a Death Star, which, if you’re a Rebel, is a looming menace. The game does take a couple of hours to play, so clear your afternoon schedule. Where you can buy Star Wars Rebellion : Amazon Australia ($133.45) | Catch ($126.95) | eBay ($132.56 with the code PLAU15 ) If you’re a fan of Sid Meier’s Civilization series, Tapestry is right up your alley. Starting from the dawn of mankind, it’s up to you to build your own civilisation from nothing and help it grow throughout the following millennia. The type of civilisation you want to build is up to you and is influenced by which of the four skills — science, technology, exploration, and military — you want to invest your points into. The variation that comes from those is what keeps me coming back to Tapestry . We don’t think we’ve built the same civilisation twice, and even when we’ve tried to repeat previous tactics, our strategy inevitability changes depending on what the other players are doing. Where you can buy Tapestry : Amazon Australia ($125.65) | Catch ($109.95) | eBay ($115.56 with the code PLAU15 ) If none of the above sounds like your thing, the good news is that there are still plenty of solid board game options out there, and you better believe Kotaku Australia has opinions about them .

Kontrakt zwiększy dostawę energii słonecznej od DTE do fabryki w Michigan o 650 megawatogodzin do 2025 roku. Ta strategiczna inwestycja realizowana w ramach MIGreenPower jest największym w historii zakupem energii odnawialnej w USA od przedsiębiorstwa użyteczności publicznej. Po montażu nowe panele zwiększą ilość pozyskiwanej energii słonecznej w Michigan o niemal 70%. Ford Motor Company i DTE Energy przeciwdziałają globalnemu ociepleniu ,,To bezprecedensowe porozumienie zapewni bardziej ekologiczną i jaśniejszą przyszłość dla Forda oraz Michigan”- powiedział Jim Farley, prezes i dyrektor generalny, Ford Motor Company. ,,Jest to także doskonały przykład tego, jak wygląda przywództwo i przekuwanie rozmów w realne działania”. Inwestycje DTE w energię odnawialną nie są jedynie działaniem w kierunku zrównoważonej produkcji. Od 2009 roku do teraz stworzyły one ponad 4 tys. nowych miejsc pracy dla mieszkańców Michigan. Firma szacuje, że nowa umowa na budowę paneli słonecznych zapewnia kolejnych 250 tymczasowych miejsc pracy oraz 10 stałych. Co więcej, lokalne społeczności, w których realizowane są fotowoltaiczne projekty DTE, korzystają z dodatkowych wpływów podatkowych generowanych z inwestycji. Oznacza to, że dochody mogą być przeznaczone do poprawy jakości życia w regionie, m.in. poprzez budowę szkół, bibliotek i dróg. ,,Gratulujemy firmie Ford Motor Company jej znaczącego przywództwa w zakresie ochrony środowiska i zaangażowania w czystą energię” – powiedział Jerry Norcia, prezes i dyrektor generalny DTE Energy. ,,Chciałbym również zauważyć, że Ford był pierwszym dużym klientem przemysłowym, który w 2019 roku zapisał się do MIGreenPower. W tym miejscu pragnę więc także podziękować firmie za ciągłe korzystanie z naszego programu, a co za tym idzie za wysiłki podjęte w celu dekarbonizacji swojej działalności i osiągnięcia planów zrównoważonego rozwoju”. Ford zaopatruje się w energię elektryczną poprzez MIGreenPower, który jest jednym z największych dobrowolnych programów energii odnawialnej w USA. Do tej pory w projekcie brało udział ponad 600 firm i ponad 62 tys. klientów indywidualnych. Przez rok użytkownicy MIGreenPower wprowadzają do programu 2,8 miliona megawatogodzin czystej energii. Wiąże się to z uniknięciem emisji aż 2,2 miliona ton dwutlenku węgla do atmosfery. DTE, największy producent energii odnawialnej w Michigan, zamierza wspierać program MIGreenPower, udostępniając tysięcy megawatogodzin nowej czystej energii. ,,Chciałabym pogratulować firmom DTE Energy i Ford Motor Company za podjęcie tak znaczącego kroku w kierunku zwiększenia pozyskiwania energii słonecznej w naszym stanie i pozycjonowania Michigan jako lidera w zakresie działań klimatycznych” – powiedziała gubernator Gretchen Whitmer. ,,Dzięki takim wysiłkom Michigan odnotowało największy wzrost zatrudnienia w sektorze energetycznym w kraju w zeszłym roku, co z kolei pomoże nam zbliżyć się do celu, jakim jest dekarbonizacja naszego stanu, stworzenie dobrze płatnych miejsc pracy i wzmocnienie gospodarki. Zgodnie z naszym MI Healthy Climate Plan, musimy podjąć natychmiastowe działania w celu złagodzenia zmian klimatycznych i zmniejszenia emisji gazów cieplarnianych tak, abyśmy mogli osiągnąć neutralność węglową w skali całej gospodarki do roku 2050. Chciałabym podkreślić, że tego typu działania jak współpraca Forda i DTE pomagają rozwijać cały stan, wykorzystując nasze bogate dziedzictwo motoryzacyjne i jednocześnie chroniąc środowisko naturalne dla przyszłych pokoleń”. Ford w Michigan Trzeba wspomnieć o tym, że marka Ford produkuje najwięcej pojazdów oraz zatrudnia najwięcej pracowników w USA ze wszystkich producentów samochodów. Firma była również jednym z pierwszych amerykańskich producentów aut, która zaangażowała się w ograniczanie skutków globalnego ocieplenia. Od momentu założenia firmy w 1903 roku Michigan cały czas pozostaje siedzibą Forda. Przez ostatnie 6 lat marka zainwestowała tu prawie 10 miliardów dolarów. Dodatkowo stworzyła i utrzymała łącznie ponad 10 tys. miejsc pracy np. w ramach renowacji Michigan Central Station lub stworzenia Ford’s Ion Park w Romulus.

This discourse reviews the idea of health insurance and its link to universal health coverage as well as the reasons informing the mandatory health insurance scheme. It seeks to point out that our laws are getting progressive whilst implementation seems not to be at par with the intention of the legislature. S. 1 of the NHIA establishes the NHIA while S. 3 provides for its functions to include, but not limited to, promote, integrate and regulate all health insurance schemes that operate in Nigeria; ensure that health insurance is mandatory for every Nigerian and legal resident; and enforce the basic minimum package of health services for all Nigerians across all health insurance schemes operating within the country, including federal, states and FCT as well as private health insurance schemes. Others are to promote, support and collaborate with states through state health insurance schemes to ensure that Nigerians have access to quality health care that meets national health regulatory standards; and to ensure the implementation and utilisation of the Basic Health Care Provision Fund as required under the National Health Act and any guidelines as approved by the minister under that Act. S. 3 (b) of the NHIA Act, under the functions of the Authority, provides for the NHIA to ensure mandatory health insurance for every Nigerian and the country’s legal residents. Health insurance is an insurance contract taken to cover the cost of medical care. The contract can be annually, monthly or over other fixed and certain periods of time. It typically caters for health care expenditures such as medical, surgical, prescription drugs, dental, and other expenses incurred by the insured. It is imperative to note that health insurance can be comprehensive or apply to a limited range of medical services. It may provide for full or partial payment of the costs of specific services. This is usually dependent on the quantum of the premium. Health insurance can reimburse the insured for expenses incurred from illness or injury treatments accessed or pay the health care provider directly. It ensures that individuals and families have access to health care services without any financial difficulty as opposed to out-of-pocket expenditure. The major difference between health insurance and out-of-pocket health expenditure is that the latter insists that patients pay upfront to access health care services whilst health insurance provides the insured (or enrolees) access to health care services which payments would be settled from the pool of contributions (premiums) paid by all the insured in the health plan. The salient elements that are basic to all the health insurance varieties include: advance remittance of premiums into the pool, gathering funds together, and being eligible to enjoy the benefits for payment of premiums made, or for being employed in situations where employment entitles a person to enjoy the benefits of health insurance. There is a distinction between health insurance and a publicly funded healthcare system, which provides coverage for every citizen or resident under a free healthcare programme. For instance, healthcare services available to indigent and poor persons by the Basic Health Care Provision Fund under S.11 of the National Health Act are not based on any premiums/insurance system but are funded through the statutory one per cent of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Federal Government. The World Health Organisation defines universal health coverage as a situation where everyone has access to the health care services they require, at the time and place they require them without financial hardship. UHC connotes a scenario where all persons and communities have access to the health services they need, at the necessary time and where they are needed without financial hardship. The services being referred to include: essential health services ranging from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care. To deliver these services, sufficient and capable health and care workers with optimal skills mix at the facility, outreach, and community levels are needed; they are to be evenly distributed and appropriately supported. UHC strategies enable everyone to access the services that address the most significant causes of disease and death in their society and also ensure that the quality of those services is good enough to improve the health of the people who receive them. UHC safeguards all people from public health risks and protects all people from impoverishment due to illness, whether from out-of-pocket payments for health care or loss of income when a household member falls sick. Full-scale expansion of health insurance is pivotal to the attainment of the above goals. Improved health outcomes are hinged on the possibility of attaining UHC in that as more persons are covered, their basic health needs are met. Protecting people from the financial hardship of having to make out-of-pocket expenditures for health services reduces the risk of their sliding into poverty when unexpected ill-health necessitates using up life savings, selling assets, or even borrowing, etc. Against the background of the foregoing, there are a plethora of reasons in support of compulsory and universal health insurance schemes in Nigeria. They are: to achieve universal health coverage, financial risk protection in accessing health care, introduce equity in financing health care and facilitate the implementation of the minimum core obligation of the state on the right to health. Others are to reduce the financial burden on the government, guarantee sustainability and credibility of health financing, facilitate the whole-of-society approach to health and set the building block for a vibrant and healthy population. Furthermore, health insurance is a means of poverty eradication, reduces inequality and uplifts the low strata of society. However, despite the mandatory nature of the scheme, there will still be citizens who due to their special financial and physical circumstances, may not be able to afford the premium to make them eligible to be covered by a health insurance scheme. This is where the core obligation of the state on the right to the highest attainable state of physical and mental health kicks in to ensure that special equity funds established under the law will fill the gap. This ensures that such persons access at the very minimum, the minimum package of care provided in the National Health Act. We now have a beautiful federal law on health insurance which is complemented by various state-level laws. These subnational laws also provided for compulsory and universal health insurance. Considering that insurance is item 33 on the Exclusive Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution, federal law will take precedence in the event of any conflict. What is now outstanding is the political will at the highest levels, expertise and capacity of the various executive and implementing agencies across the federation to ensure that the new regime of compulsory health insurance translates to improvements in universal health coverage.

The term \"faucet\" refers to the small amount of rewards, similar to the tiny drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet that could fill a cup over time. One of the first crypto faucets is the Bitcoin faucet developed in 2010 by Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. Users who completed a simple captcha could earn up to 5 BTC at a time, and 19,715 BTC in total were eventually distributed, assisting in the widespread distribution of early BTC ownership. The Bitcoin faucet was instrumental in educating the initial network of Bitcoin users, resulting in the cryptocurrency's healthy expansion later. Crypto faucets are less generous today, as the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. However, crypto faucets still play a crucial role in educating new users about cryptocurrency projects and the technology powering them and assisting novices in their crypto journey. Read on to learn everything you need to know about crypto faucets, how crypto faucets work, and how to earn free cryptocurrencies by completing simple tasks. Additionally, we've compiled a list of the best crypto faucets for earning free crypto assets in 2022 to help you avoid scammers or other malicious actors looking to infect your computer or compromise your privacy.So without further ado, let’s get right to it! What Are Crypto Faucets A crypto faucet is a reward system that gives users free coins in return for performing basic tasks. To obtain free crypto, users are asked to complete simple tasks, i.e., watch videos, play games, take surveys, complete quizzes or a captcha, etc. Crypto faucets aren't a get-rich-quick scheme; they're simply fun, educational, and let you earn some free stuff in return for simple work. The simpler the work, the smaller the reward. Moreover, sometimes you must invest some time to accumulate the minimum threshold of cryptocurrencies that can be withdrawn to your wallet. Most websites have a minimum withdrawal limit on tasks, and rewards are usually sent into an internal crypto wallet when users reach the withdrawal threshold set by the platform. With the best crypto faucets, this can take as little as a day, but it can also take up to a week. Crypto faucets provide users with free cryptocurrencies to increase awareness of new cryptocurrency projects, educate users about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and encourage them to invest in them. How Do Crypto Faucets Work Crypto faucets help companies earn profits and maximize their revenue through \"traffic arbitrage,\" i.e., by sending traffic to advertising networks. Crypto facet users earn crypto rewards, i.e., a tiny portion of the revenue from the ad networks, in return for viewing ads. The same revenue-share arbitrage model works with captcha, gaming networks, survey companies, affiliate networks, etc. Crypto faucets are easy to use - you must sign up for a digital asset service or visit a cryptocurrency faucet website or app that offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for playing games, conducting surveys, watching advertisements, etc. Due to high transaction fees, networks use a micro wallet and a micropayments platform to pay off faucet rewards when the minimum withdrawal limit is reached. The earned cryptocurrency is sent to your online mini-wallet by the crypto faucet's website or app. Micro wallets are often created once you sign up for a crypto faucet. You can cash out when this micro-allocated wallet achieves a certain threshold of rewards (say, $5-10 in Bitcoin). When this happens, all the cryptocurrency is instantly moved to your actual crypto wallets. Crypto Faucet Types One way to categorize crypto faucets is by the token paid out as a reward. In the past, crypto faucets used to pay rewards in only a single cryptocurrency. The first currency-specific faucet was the Bitcoin faucet, paying rewards only in satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. Later on, in addition to Bitcoin faucets, other faucets like Litecoin faucets (Free LTC), Ethereum faucets, Monero faucets, Bitcoin Cash faucets, etc., were created. For example, Ethereum faucets pay users a certain amount of ETH for completing tasks such as solving captchas, as mandated by Ethereum-faucet.org. You can also earn ETH tokens by mining websites and solving captchas using Fire Faucet. Dutchy CORP is another free Ethereum faucet where you can complete tasks and play games to earn rewards. Currently, Altcoin Multicurrency Faucetssupport reward payouts in multiple cryptocurrencies. You can choose to withdraw your rewards in a variety of alternative coins supported by the faucet. Crypto faucets vary from airdrops, referring to crypto assets being dropped into traders’ crypto wallets. An airdrop is a marketing strategy that usually requires participants to register with several platforms, be active on social media and internet forums, share posts, join discussions, etc., to earn rewards. During an airdrop, projects give away free tokens to promote their brand and gain awareness of their token. Crypto faucets also differ from bounties, a list of reward-earning tasks published by a blockchain project. Bounties are a way for a blockchain project to solicit community participation and give out one-time crypto rewards to anyone who can complete specific tasks. Top 10 Crypto Faucets Crypto faucets have grown in popularity to earn free money through investing your time. You can earn free cryptocurrency by completing easy tasks as described above. Below is the list of the 10 most popular crypto faucets to help you get started: 1. Tamadoge Tamadoge (TAMA) is an interesting new crypto project that's giving away $100,000 in tokens to investors who hold TAMA on the day of the drawing. TAMA is a meme coin with a twist, providing holders with NFT ownership, a play-to-earn game, and giveaways in addition to potentially big returns. Tamadoge homepage TAMA is already proving to be one of the best new cryptocurrencies on the market, having received $2 million in its presale and employing deflationary tokenomics in which 5% of every transaction is burnt. Tamaverse also offers NFT ownership and a fun play-to-earn game that consists of gathering, battling, and training 3D animated Tamadoge pets. Food and toys help the pets grow, and once they reach a certain size, they can compete against other pets, earning their owners points to climb a worldwide leaderboard, with rewards awarded on a monthly basis. By the third quarter of 2023, pets will be available in Augmented Reality, allowing owners to walk out into the real world with their pets and earn TAMA tokens and other rewards. 2. FreeBitcoin FreeBitcoin, founded in 2013, is one of the best Bitcoin faucets accessible today.

The term \"faucet\" refers to the small amount of rewards, similar to the tiny drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet that could fill a cup over time. One of the first crypto faucets is the Bitcoin faucet developed in 2010 by Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. Users who completed a simple captcha could earn up to 5 BTC at a time, and 19,715 BTC in total were eventually distributed, assisting in the widespread distribution of early BTC ownership. The Bitcoin faucet was instrumental in educating the initial network of Bitcoin users, resulting in the cryptocurrency's healthy expansion later. Crypto faucets are less generous today, as the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed. However, crypto faucets still play a crucial role in educating new users about cryptocurrency projects and the technology powering them and assisting novices in their crypto journey. Read on to learn everything you need to know about crypto faucets, how crypto faucets work, and how to earn free cryptocurrencies by completing simple tasks. Additionally, we've compiled a list of the best crypto faucets for earning free crypto assets in 2022 to help you avoid scammers or other malicious actors looking to infect your computer or compromise your privacy.So without further ado, let’s get right to it! What Are Crypto Faucets A crypto faucet is a reward system that gives users free coins in return for performing basic tasks. To obtain free crypto, users are asked to complete simple tasks, i.e., watch videos, play games, take surveys, complete quizzes or a captcha, etc. Crypto faucets aren't a get-rich-quick scheme; they're simply fun, educational, and let you earn some free stuff in return for simple work. The simpler the work, the smaller the reward. Moreover, sometimes you must invest some time to accumulate the minimum threshold of cryptocurrencies that can be withdrawn to your wallet. Most websites have a minimum withdrawal limit on tasks, and rewards are usually sent into an internal crypto wallet when users reach the withdrawal threshold set by the platform. With the best crypto faucets, this can take as little as a day, but it can also take up to a week. Crypto faucets provide users with free cryptocurrencies to increase awareness of new cryptocurrency projects, educate users about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, and encourage them to invest in them. How Do Crypto Faucets Work Crypto faucets help companies earn profits and maximize their revenue through \"traffic arbitrage,\" i.e., by sending traffic to advertising networks. Crypto facet users earn crypto rewards, i.e., a tiny portion of the revenue from the ad networks, in return for viewing ads. The same revenue-share arbitrage model works with captcha, gaming networks, survey companies, affiliate networks, etc. Crypto faucets are easy to use - you must sign up for a digital asset service or visit a cryptocurrency faucet website or app that offers free cryptocurrency in exchange for playing games, conducting surveys, watching advertisements, etc. Due to high transaction fees, networks use a micro wallet and a micropayments platform to pay off faucet rewards when the minimum withdrawal limit is reached. The earned cryptocurrency is sent to your online mini-wallet by the crypto faucet's website or app. Micro wallets are often created once you sign up for a crypto faucet. You can cash out when this micro-allocated wallet achieves a certain threshold of rewards (say, $5-10 in Bitcoin). When this happens, all the cryptocurrency is instantly moved to your actual crypto wallets. Crypto Faucet Types One way to categorize crypto faucets is by the token paid out as a reward. In the past, crypto faucets used to pay rewards in only a single cryptocurrency. The first currency-specific faucet was the Bitcoin faucet, paying rewards only in satoshis, the smallest unit of BTC. Later on, in addition to Bitcoin faucets, other faucets like Litecoin faucets (Free LTC), Ethereum faucets, Monero faucets, Bitcoin Cash faucets, etc., were created. For example, Ethereum faucets pay users a certain amount of ETH for completing tasks such as solving captchas, as mandated by Ethereum-faucet.org. You can also earn ETH tokens by mining websites and solving captchas using Fire Faucet. Dutchy CORP is another free Ethereum faucet where you can complete tasks and play games to earn rewards. Currently, Altcoin Multicurrency Faucetssupport reward payouts in multiple cryptocurrencies. You can choose to withdraw your rewards in a variety of alternative coins supported by the faucet. Crypto faucets vary from airdrops, referring to crypto assets being dropped into traders’ crypto wallets. An airdrop is a marketing strategy that usually requires participants to register with several platforms, be active on social media and internet forums, share posts, join discussions, etc., to earn rewards. During an airdrop, projects give away free tokens to promote their brand and gain awareness of their token. Crypto faucets also differ from bounties, a list of reward-earning tasks published by a blockchain project. Bounties are a way for a blockchain project to solicit community participation and give out one-time crypto rewards to anyone who can complete specific tasks.

In comparison, the S&P BSE Sensex was down 0.86 per cent at 59,135 points at 09:52 am. The stock has zoomed past 50 per cent in a month on strong earnings and healthy outlook. Meanwhile, in the past six months, the stock price of WCPM has more-than-doubled or soared 137 per cent, as against 3 per cent rise in the benchmark Sensex. For the April-June quarter (Q1FY23), the company posted over five-fold jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 208.95 crore from Rs 39.20 crore in the previous year quarter, on the back of strong operational performance. On a sequential basis, net profit of the company grew 49 per cent from Rs 140.51 crore. WCPM is involved in manufacturing of diversified range of products and has increased its presence across writing and printing segment, security and high value grade paper, creating a niche for the company in the market. Segment-wise, the packaging paper segment has witnessed a rise with growth in demand from e-commerce, food and food products, FMCG and the pharmaceutical sector. However, the demand is expected to grow 11-15 per cent year on year in the current fiscal as schools, colleges and office spaces gradually re-open. That apart, the new education policy is expected to increase student enrolment at a relatively faster pace. A gradual rise in education expenses by the Government and increased thrust on education are also likely to support demand for creamwove and maplitho (60- 65 per cent P&W segment). As the company’s cable division entered into an agreement for supply of cables with large Indian Telcos, the management believes that a large network integrator for Tanfinet project and robust order book would help growth of their cable business. \"With upcoming growth in the Indian and global market with 5G and FTTH, the company is well placed to take up growth path. In direction to substantially increase the footprint in export market, this year has seen good growth and we expect to double growth year-on-year for exports,\" the company said. WCPM's acquisition of Andhra Paper (APL) in October 2019 significantly improved the company's scale and market position, making it the fifth-largest paper manufacturer in India, with a consolidated capacity of 568,000 metric tonnes per annum (mtpa). Analysts at India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) believe that the fundamental demand prospect for paper remains stable over the medium term, given its under penetration across segments. They expect that the paper demand in the education sector would continue to grow with an increase in the literacy rate. Though copier paper could experience some slowdown over the near term, the increasing usage of computers in the sub-urban and rural areas will gradually replace the lost volumes from metro cities due to the ongoing remote working. \"Overall, the writing and printing segment is likely to grow at low single digits compared to mid-single digit in the pre-covid period. However, with growing consumerism and e-commerce, and the ban on plastic usage in several states, demand for cupstock and packaging paper is likely to be healthy over the medium term,\" the brokerage firm said.","pubDate":"2022-08-22 05:06:40","image_url":null,"source_id":"business-standard","country":["india"],"category":["top"],"language":"english"}]
